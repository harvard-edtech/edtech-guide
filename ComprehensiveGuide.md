# Set Up Your Workspace

_Note:_ if using windows, start by installing a terminal replacement like Git Bash. It must function like a Mac OS or Linux machine. Otherwise, virtualize Linux.

In each new project, switch to standard unix-style line breaks:

```bash
git config core.autocrlf false 
git rm --cached -r . 
git reset --hard
```

Always make sure your git config is set to detect case-sensitive filename changes:

```bash
git config --global core.ignorecase false
```

## Typescript

Javascript environment:

1. Install Node.js LTS
1. Install NVM

NPM setup

1. Install npx using `npm i -g npx`

## Code Editor

Install required VSCode extensions:

1. `Code Spell Checker` by Street Side Software - flags spelling errors in your code
1. `ESLint` by Microsoft - required for eslint enforcement
1. `npm` by Microsoft - required for code highlighting
1. `TODO Highlight` by Wayou Liu (alternative is okay) - highlights TODOs

Remove banned extensions or disable them on all our projects:

1. `GitHub Copilot` - this removes opportunity for learning
1. `Tabnine` â€“ this removes opportunity for learning and introduces unintended code
1. `Prettier` - formats in ways that do not necessarily follow our rules

If you want, install optional VSCode extensions:

1. `Path Intellisense` by Christian Kohler - helps auto-complete local imports
1. `npm Intellisense` by Christian Kohler - helps auto-complete lib imports
1. `Auto Close Tag` by Jun Han - automatically closes html tags
1. `gitignore` by michelemelluso - right click and add to gitignore
1. `Thunder Client` by Ranga Vadhineni - lets you easily send api requests for testing

Update these VSCode settings:

1. Change "EOL" style to "\n" (LF)
1. Use two spaces instead of tabs
1. Emmet: Show Expanded Abbreviation = inMarkupAndStylesheetFilesOnly
1. Turn on "Bracket Pair Colorization"
1. Typescript Preferences > Quote Style = "single"

Troubleshooting ESLint:

If eslint isn't working on the project, first try reinstalling it: Shift + CMD/Ctrl + P > Reinstall Extension > ESLint.

If that doesn't fix it, try the solutions in this [ESLint Troubleshooting Checklist](https://dev.to/tillsanders/eslint-not-working-in-vscode-help-build-a-troubleshooting-checklist-fdc).

# Project and File Management

## Assigned Tasks

We use GitHub Projects as our task management system. To see what you're assigned, visit the repo, click `Projects`, click our project, and take a look at the `Assigned` column. Cards with your picture on them are yours to do this week.

When you start working on a task, drag the card to `In Progress`. 

When you finish a task, drag the card to `In Review`.

We'll peer-review each-other's work before moving cards to `Done`.

As you work, keep track of everything you work on and update your Google Sheet with things you've done and minutes you've spent.

## GitHub

The main branch of the project is managed by Gabe. Anything that makes it to `main` is Gabe's responsibility, so please do not merge into `main`.

<Rule tall>
  Never commit, merge, or push to main
</Rule>

For each task you work on, check the title and label of the card in GitHub Projects. That label may be "enhancement" or "new-feature" etc.

Before starting to work on that task, create a new branch labeled `<label>/<lowercase-dashed-title>`.

<Rule>
  One branch per task, named appropriately
</Rule>

```bash
# For an "enhancement" task called "Add Simplification Algorithm"
git checkout stage
git pull
git checkout -b enhancement/add-simplification-algorithm
```

For your own public credit on GitHub and for traceability, we prefer that you commit and push to your branch very often.

<Rule>
  Commit and push to your branch frequently
</Rule>

```bash
# Always push after you commit
git add ...
git commit -m "description of what you did"
git push ...
```

When done with your task, submit a pull request to `stage` and describe everything you did in detail. Finally, request a review from a peer or from Gabe and let everyone know in Slack.

## File Management

We use a strict file structure for all our projects. This helps us get around each other's code and greatly improves modularity and encourages code reuse.

Modules can take one of two structures: one/two files or folder. A module must be a folder if it has any helpers, sub-components, or more than two files for any other reason. There is one exception to this: test files are not included in this count, so you may end up with three files instead of a folder if one of them is a test.

<Rule>
  Modules must be folders if they have helpers, sub-components, or more than 2 files
</Rule>

```ts
// Allowed: 
MyComponent.tsx
MyComponent.scss

// BUT MUST BE A FOLDER...

// If there are 3+ files:
MyComponent/
    index.tsx
    style.scss
    logo.png

// OR

// If there are helpers:
MyComponent/
    index.tsx
    helpers/
        myHelper.tsx

// Or if there are sub-components:
MyComponent/
    index.tsx
    MySubComponent.tsx
    MySubComponent.scss
```

# Typescript Basics

## Types

### Primitives

- `number` - all number types (int, float, etc.)
- `string` - text of any length
- `boolean` - either true or false
- `undefined` - unset
- `null` - no value
- `void` - either `undefined` or `null` - but we refrain from using it

### Important Data Structures

- `Array` - array of elements
- `Map` - dictionary with keys and values
- `Set` - set where items can only exist once in the list
- `Object` - unordered map where keys must be strings

### Types and Enums

- `Type/Interface` - a data type/interface
- `Enum` - an enum (does not support dynamic keys or values that are objects)

## Creating Variables

Use `const` when defining variables. Only use `let` if absolutely necessary (a variable's value changes). It is unforgivable to use `var`.

<Rule>
  Use const to define vars. Only use let if necessary
</Rule>

```ts
// Good
const name = 'Divardo';

// Good
const getName = () => { ... };

// Good only because age is modified later
let age = 10;
...
age += 1;
```

Object property modification do **not** count as re-assigning:

```js
// Still use const
const user = {
    name: 'Divardo',
    age: 10,
};

// These do not modify user
user.name = 'Jane';
user.age += 1;
```

We favor longer variable names that are descriptive: `mouseX` is better than `x`.

<Rule>
  Use appropriate naming conventions
</Rule>

```ts
// Variable:
favoriteFruits

// Constant:
FAVORITE_FRUITS // (all caps with underscores)

// Enum:
FavoriteFruit // (notice this is not pluralized)

// Typescript Class (not a css class):
FavoriteFruits

// Component:
FavoriteFruits

// CSS class:
.FavoriteFruits-container
```

If a variable is an optional boolean, always name it such that `false` is the default value. For example, if users are usually online while using the tool, an optional status boolean should be named `isOffline` so that `false` can be the default value (instead of `isOnline` where `true` is the default value). You'll really appreciate this consistency farther down the line and when reading other people's code. This is especially useful in React with optional boolean component props which are only added if the boolean is true (if the default is false, it saves a lot of useless extra code).

<Rule>
  When naming css classes, always prefix every class with the name of the component
</Rule>

```css
/* For component Favorite Fruits: */

/* Good: */
.FavoriteFruits-container

/* Bad: */
.container
```

<Rule>
  Name optional booleans such that false is the default value
</Rule>

```ts
// If users are usually teachers...

// Bad:
const isNotStudent?: boolean = ...

// Good
const isStudent?: boolean = ...
```

All variables must have types. If typescript cannot infer a type, one must be explicitly defined.

<Rule>
  All variables must have specific types (if not defined or inferred)
</Rule>

```ts
const name: string = getName();
// Note: always include a space before the type
```

All numbers must include units, either in the variable name itself or in a comment at the variable's declaration:

<Rule>
  All numbers must include units
</Rule>

```ts
// Good:
const heightFt = 5;
// or
const height = 5; // ft

// Bad:
const height = 5;
```

If you have the option to choose units, here are our preferred set of units:

- timestamp/time = ms
- age = years
- date = ms since epoch
- video timestamp = seconds since start of video

We reserve single quotes for typescript and double quotes for JSX. This makes our code differentiable and nestable.

<Rule>
  Only use single quotes in typescript
</Rule>

```ts
import toggleButton from 'toggle-button';

const name = 'Divardo';
```

Arrays that start off empty must have a declared type.

<Rule>
  Arrays must have declared types
</Rule>

```ts
const names: string[] = [];
// or
const names = new Array<string>();
```

Objects must be defined with proper spacing to preserve clarity.

<Rule>
  Space out object properties
</Rule>

```ts
// Good:
const user = { name: 'Divardo' };

// Bad:
const user = {name: 'Divardo'};
```

If adding a variable to an object with the same name, use shorthand.

<Rule>
  Used object property shorthand
</Rule>

```ts
const name = 'Divardo';
const age = 10;

// Good:
const user = { name, age };

// Bad:
const user = { name: name, age: age };
```

### Simple Operations

Always use `===` for equality. If you're using `==` there had better be a really good reason.

<Rule>
  Always use ===  or !== for equality comparisons
</Rule>

```ts
if (name === 'Divardo') {
    ...
}
```

Triple equals (`===`) compares type and value. Thus, `'5' === 5` is false.

If you want to compare just value and not type, convert the variables first: `Number.parseInt('5', 10) === 5`, which will now return true.

If you want to do a deep comparison of two objects, use a library.

Math must be readable and grouped. Only one operation can happen in each parentheses group.

<Rule>
  Wrap each mathematical operation in parentheses
</Rule>

```ts
const x = (((a + b) * (c + d)) / e);
```

It turns out few people understand the subtleties of `num++` or `num--`, so we do not use those operators except in for loops, where its use is well-understood.

<Rule>
  Only use ++ or -- in for loop declaration
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
age++;

// Good:
age += 1;
```

This works nicely with other mathematical operations:

- Add: `age += 2`
- Multiply: `age *= 3`
- Divide: `age /= 5`
- Subtract: `age -= 1`

String addition must always be done using template strings.

<Rule>
  Only use template strings for string addition
</Rule>

```ts
const weather = `The temperature is ${temp} today`;
```

Never nest ternaries and always wrap them in parentheses, even if they're short.

<Rule>
  Never nest ternaries
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
const beingType = (age > 150 ? (allergy === 'sun' ? 'vampire' : 'zombie') : 'human');

// Good:
const monsterType = (allergy === 'sun' ? 'vampire' : 'zombie');
const beingType = (age > 150 ? monsterType : 'human');
```

<Rule>
  Put complex ternaries on multiple lines
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad
const carStatus = (miles > getCarMiles() ? `${make} is older than ${standard}` : 'new');

// Good
const carStatus = (
  miles > getCarMiles()
    ? `${make} is older than ${standard}`
    : 'new'
);
```

<Rule>
  Wrap multiline ternaries with parentheses, place condition on its own line
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad
const carStatus = miles > getCarMiles()
  ? `${make} is older than ${standard}`
  : 'new'
;

// Bad
const carStatus = (miles > getCarMiles()
  ? `${make} is older than ${standard}`
  : 'new'
);

// Good
const carStatus = (
  miles > getCarMiles()
    ? `${make} is older than ${standard}`
    : 'new'
);
```

<Rule>
  Operators always start lines
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
const carStatus = (
  miles > getCarMiles() ?
    `${make} is older than ${standard}` :
    'new'
);

// Good
const carStatus = (
  miles > getCarMiles()
    ? `${make} is older than ${standard}`
    : 'new'
);

// Bad:
const isInClass = (
  joinedZoom ||
  sittingInPerson ||
  watchedVideo
);

// Good:
const isInClass = (
  joinedZoom
  || sittingInPerson
  || watchedVideo
);

// Bad:
const age = (
  currentAge +
  elapsedTime
);

// Good:
const age = (
  currentAge
  + elapsedTime
);
```

When retrieving values from objects or tuples (arrays of length 2), you can destructure. We prefer that you do not alias (do not rename destructured values). This helps other programmers follow data around your code and also helps when people use `find` or other searching mechanisms.

<Rule>
  Destructure where possible. Do not alias unless necessary
</Rule>

```ts
const {
  name,
  age,
} = person;
```

## Functions

We never use the `function` keyword. It's been outdated for years.

<Rule>
  Never use the function keyword
</Rule>

```ts
// Banned:
function honk(horn) {
    ...
}
```

Use arrow functions as much as possible: this ensures appropriate context binding and reduces complexity.

<Rule>
  Use arrow functions as much as possible
</Rule>

```ts
// Helper
const honk = (horn: HondaHorn) => {
    ...
};

// Inline
cars.forEach((car) => {
    ...
});
```

To keep our arrow functions uniform, we try not to use shorthand unless it's very helpful. Thus, parentheses around arguments are usually required and curly brackets are usually required surrounding the body, even if the function is very simple. Similarly, most arrow functions should be multiline.

<Rule>
  Arrow functions usually have ( ) and { } and are usually multiline
</Rule>

```ts
// Banned:
(x) => x + 1

// Banned:
name => { print(name); }

// Good:
(x) => {
  return x + 1;
}

// Good:
(name) => {
  print(name);
}
```

### Documentation

All named functions absolutely must have JSDoc definitions. Include a description of the purpose of the function, add one or more author tags for people who worked on that function, and describe arguments and return.

<Rule>
  Add JSDoc to all named functions
</Rule>

```ts
/**
 * Prepares a car to race: fills up the tank and tests the engine
 * @author Your Name
 * @param car the car to prepare
 * @param raceType the type of race to prepare for
 * @returns cost of the preparation process in USD
 */
const prepareCar = async (car: Car, raceType: RaceType): number => {
    ...
};
```

Notice that data types are included inline in the typescript function declaration. To minimize documentation update issues, keep data types and sync/async status inline in the typescript. Do not include them in JSDoc. Thus, `{type}` tags and the `@async` keyword are not allowed

<Rule>
  Don't duplicate descriptions with JSDoc
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
/**
 * Prepares a car to race: fills up the tank and tests the engine
 * @author Your Name
 * @async
 * @param {Car} car the car to prepare
 * @param {RaceType} raceType the type of race to prepare for
 * @returns cost of the preparation process in USD
 */
const prepareCar = async (car: Car, raceType: RaceType): number => {
  ...
};

// Good:
/**
 * Prepares a car to race: fills up the tank and tests the engine
 * @author Your Name
 * @param car the car to prepare
 * @param raceType the type of race to prepare for
 * @returns cost of the preparation process in USD
 */
const prepareCar = async (car: Car, raceType: RaceType): number => {
  ...
};
```

## Classes

Ask yourself: should this code be a helper function or a class? One rule of thumb is that if code will only be instantiated once, it's probably best as a helper function.

All variables in the class must be defined at the top of the class (all `this.xyz` variable).

<Rule>
  Define all instance properties at top of class
</Rule>

```ts
class User {
  private name: string;
  private age: number;
  private pronouns?: string;
  private gender?: string;

  ...
}
```

Every property and methods must be labeled as either `private` or `public`. We require that you make an active decision on privacy. Note: `#` is an acceptable substitute for `private` if you prefer.

<Rule>
  All class properties and methods must either be private or public
</Rule>

```ts
class User {
  // Bad:
  name: string;

  // Good:
  private name: string;

  // Bad:
  getName(): string {
    ...
  }

  // Good:
  public getName(): string {
    ...
  }
}
```

If a method doesn't refer to `this`, then there's no reason it can't be a `static` method. Thus, if a method doesn't refer to `this`, we require that it be `static`. This helps because it's easy for others to figure out if a function depends on class variables.

<Rule>
  Methods that don't reference "this" must be static
</Rule>

```ts
class User {
  // Bad:
  public sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello!');
  }

  // Good:
  public static sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello!');
  }

  // Good:
  public getName(): string {
    return this.name;
  }
}
```

## Types

We use `Type` to define types (instead of `Interface`) because of some important advanced features that we leverage in React.

<Rule>
  Wherever possible, use Type instead of Interface
</Rule>

```ts
type Car = {
  ...
};
```

We treat types as objects, ending lines with `,` instead of `;`. This isn't because of very important functionality, this is just for consistency. The commas show that each item is part of the whole.

<Rule>
  Delimit types with commas
</Rule>

```ts
type Car = {
  // Company that the car was made by
  make: string,
  // Age
  age: number, // years
};
```

Every property in a type must be accompanied by a full description and units (as usual). Comment above each item.

<Rule>
  Describe all type properties
</Rule>

```ts
// Good:
type Car = {
  // Company that the car was made by
  make: string,
  // Age of the car
  age: number, // years
};

// Bad:
type Car = {
  make: string,
  age: number,
};
```

If a type can have multiple different structures, use `|`:

<Rule>
  If a type has multiple forms, separate by |
</Rule>

```ts
type Vehicle = (
  | {
    // Type of vehicle
    type: 'car',
    // Number of wheels
    numWheels: number,
    // True if car fits in a compact parking spot
    isCompact: boolean,
  }
  | {
    // Type of vehicle
    type: 'truck',
    // Number of wheels
    numWheels: number,
    // True if truck has a trailer hitch
    hasTrailerHitch: boolean,
  }
);
```

### Types Cheatsheet

For your reference, here's a types cheatsheet with props that I use frequently:

```ts
// Primitives
string // String
number // Number
boolean // Boolean
undefined // Unset value
null // Absence of value

// Operations
(string | number) // Any type in this list
('blue' | 'red' | 'green') // Any value in a list

// Arrays
string[] // Array of strings
number[] // Array of numbers
Car[] // Array containing objects of type Car
Array<(string | Car)> // Array of strings or objects of type Car

// Enums
EnumName // Enums also function as types

// Common Data Structures
{ [k: string]: number } // Object where keys are strings, values are numbers
Map<string, Car> // Map where keys are strings, values are objects of type Car
Set<Car> // Set of objects of type Car

// Functions
() => undefined // Function with no arguments, no return
(car: Car) => undefined // Function with an argument and no return value
(car: Car, year?: number) => number // Function with optional arg and return type

// Object with specific structure
{
  name: string,
  age?: number,
}

// React types
React.ReactNode // Renderable React content
React.FC<Props> // Functional Component

// Types to avoid
any
unknown
```

Avoid casting at all costs, but if it must be done, use the `as` keyword:

```ts
const user = (await fetchUserFromAPI()) as User;
```

## Enums

If a value can take on many pre-determined values, we use enums. However, we understand that enums are limited: keys are not dynamic and values cannot be complex objects. Use enums where possible.

<Rule>
  Prefer enums, but substitute with objects if not possible
</Rule>

```ts
enum Instrument {
  Piano = 'Piano',
  Violin = 'Violin',
}
```

There are shorthands for numerical enums. To ensure readable database entries and debugging, we prefer string-valued enums, even if those values are just a lowercase version of the key.

## Code Style

To keep code readable and simple, if there are ever more than three of anything (arguments, values, anything), each must be on its own line.

<Rule>
  If more than three elements, put each element on its own line
</Rule>

```ts
Additionally, whenever there is one item on its own line, all other items must be on their own lines as well.
```

Arrays:

```js
// Bad: first item is not on its own line
const fruits = ['Apple',
    'Orange',
    'Pineapple',
    'Mango',
];

// Bad: last item is not on its own line
const fruits = [
    'Apple',
    'Orange',
    'Pineapple',
    'Mango'];

// Good
const fruits = [
    'Apple',
    'Orange',
    'Pineapple',
    'Mango',
];
```

Function calls:

```ts
// Bad: first item is not on its own line
const firstName = database.initialize()
    .getUser()
    .firstName;

// Bad
const firstName = (
    database.initialize()
        .getUser()
        .firstName
);

// Good
const firstName = (
    database
        .initialize()
        .getUser()
        .firstName
);
```

Arguments:

```ts
// Bad: first item is not on its own line
startCar(Engine.getFourCylinder(),
    WheelKit.manufacture(4),
    Horn.prepare(),
);

// Bad: last item is not on its own line
startCar(Engine.getFourCylinder(),
    WheelKit.manufacture(4),
    Horn.prepare());

// Good
startCar(
    Engine.getFourCylinder(),
    WheelKit.manufacture(4),
    Horn.prepare(),
);
```

For all arrays, function arguments, object definitions, and other comma-delineated objects, use trailing commas. This helps create clean git diffs and reduces typos.

<Rule>
  Use trailing commas
</Rule>

```
See the examples above. Look for trailing commas.

Note: this is not supported in `.json` files. Thus, when possible, we prefer `.tsx` for data if possible.
```

# Typescript Advanced Stuff

## Array Functions

Array functions are awesome. Replace loops with array functions wherever possible. Unfortunately, array functions do not fully support async/await yet. That's the only time we must use a `for` loop.

<Rule>
  Use array functions whenever possible unless await is used inside
</Rule>

```ts
// Good:
fruits.forEach((fruit: Fruit) => {
    console.log(`I love ${fruit}s`);
});

// Bad:
fruits.forEach(async (fruit: Fruit) => {
    await fruit.waitToRipen();
});

// Good
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
    await fruits[i].waitToRipen();
}
```

### Array.forEach â€“ loop

```ts
const fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'pineapple'];

fruits.forEach((fruit: string) => {
    console.log(`I love ${fruit}s`);
});

// Output:
// > I love apples
// > I love oranges
// > I love pineapples
```

You can also get the element's index:

```ts
fruits.forEach((fruit, i) => {
    // ...
});
```

### Array.map â€“ create new value based on each item

```ts
const cars: Car[] = [
  {
    color: 'red',
    year: 2015,
  },
  {
    color: 'blue',
    year: 2018,
  },
];

const years: number[] = cars.map((car: Car) => {
    return car.year;
});

const olderCars: Car[] = cars.map((car: Car) => {
    return {
        ...car,
        year: car.year - 1,
    };
});
```

<Rule>
  Never modify function arguments
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
const olderCars: Car[] = cars.map((car: Car) => {
    car.year -= 1;

    return car;
});

// Good:
const olderCars: Car[] = cars.map((car: Car) => {
    return {
        ...car,
        year: car.year - 1,
    };
});
```

### Array.some â€“Â returns true if at least one passes the test

```ts
const cars: Car[] = [
  {
    color: 'red',
    year: 2015,
  },
  {
    color: 'blue',
    year: 2018,
  },
];

const atLeastOneRed = cars.some((car: Car) => {
    return (car.color === 'red');
});
```

### Array.every â€“Â returns true if all pass the test

```ts
const cars: Car[] = [
  {
    color: 'red',
    year: 2015,
  },
  {
    color: 'blue',
    year: 2018,
  },
];

const allCarsAreRed = cars.every((car: Car) => {
    return (car.color === 'red');
});
```

### Array.filter â€“ filters an array, keeping only items that pass the test

```ts
const cars: Car[] = [
  {
    color: 'red',
    year: 2015,
  },
  {
    color: 'blue',
    year: 2018,
  },
];

const redCars = cars.filter((car: Car) => {
    return (car.color === 'red');
});
```

## Object Functions

Object functions are great for iterating through objects. Use them whenever possible. But just like array functions, if using async/await inside the loop, you'll need a for loop.

<Rule>
  Use object functions whenever possible unless await is used inside
</Rule>

### Object.keys(...) â€“ get an array of keys

```js
const idToName = {
  12459: 'Divardo',
  50829: 'Calicci',
  50628: 'Keala',
};

const ids = Object.keys(idToName);
```

### Object.values(...) â€“ get an array of values

```js
const idToName = {
  12459: 'Divardo',
  50829: 'Calicci',
  50628: 'Keala',
};

const names = Object.values(idToName);
```

### Combine with array functions

It's often important to loop through an enum or object's keys or values.

```ts
Object.values(idToName).forEach((name: string) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});
```

## Default Params

To include a default value for a param, do this:

```ts
const helper = (a: string, b: string = 'default value') => {
  // ...
};
```

<Rule>
  All required params must come before default params
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
const helper = (a: string, b: string = 'hi', c: number) => {
  ...
};
```

With types and defaults, arguments can take up a lot of space. As usual, if one item is on another line, all items must be on their own lines. Here's how to do this with arguments:

```ts
const helper = (
  requiredParam1: string,
  requiredParam2: number,
  optionalParam: string = 'default value',
) => {
  // ...
};
```

## Modules

Our npm projects are divided into modules. We use es6 import/export syntax.

### Creating a Module

To create a module, create a `.tsx` file and at the end of the file, on one line, export the item of interest as the default export.

<Rule>
  Default export must be at the end of the file
</Rule>

```ts
...

export default MyComponent;
```

The file name must match the name of the default export. This helps with consistency and helps with automatic documentation.

<Rule>
  Default export name must match file name
</Rule>

```ts
// Chart/index.tsx
export default MyComponent;

// MyButton.tsx
export default MyButton;
```

If an item takes up more than one line, define it above and then export it on one line.

<Rule>
  Export must be on a single line
</Rule>

```ts
const MyCar = {
    ...
};

export default MyCar;
```

### Importing a Module

When importing a module, leave out the extension if it's a `.ts` or `.tsx` file.

<Rule>
  When importing, leave off extension if ".tsx"
</Rule>

```ts
import MyComponent from '../shared/MyComponent';
```

If a module is a folder, leave off `index.tsx` when importing.

<Rule>
  Leave off "index.tsx" when importing file modules
</Rule>

```ts
// File structure
MyComponent/
    index.tsx
    style.scss
    MyButton.tsx

// Bad:
import MyComponent from './MyComponent/index';

// Good:
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
```

## Asynchronous Code

Typescript is a single-threaded interpreted language and is _much_ slower than C/C++ and other compiled languages. _But_, asynchronous code runs really fast and is great for servers and good for simple clients like browsers. Thus, Express and React are great choices as long as we use asynchronous code when necessary.

### Asynchronous Functions

This function is non-blocking and executes its function body in the background.

```ts
const funcName = async () => {
  ...
};
```

Always use the `async` keyword instead of returning `Promise` objects. In fact, refrain from referencing `Promise` except in types and when using `Promise.all`.

<Rule>
  Only reference Promise when using Promise.all or when defining types
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
const ready = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  ...
});

// Bad:
loadFile.then((contents) => {
  // ...
});
// (where loadFile returns a promise)

// Bad:
const funcName = () => {
  ...
  const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    ...
  });
  ...
  return p;
};

// Okay:
const funcName = async (): Promise<number> => {
  ...
  await doSomething();
  ...
  return 5;
};

// Okay:
await Promise.all(tasks);
```

### Waiting for async tasks

To wait for an async task, always use `await` instead of `.then`.

<Rule>
  Use await instead of .then
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
fruit.ripe().then(() => {
  console.log('The fruit is ripe!');
});

// Good:
await fruit.ripe();
```

To catch an error from an awaited task, just surround with `try/catch` instead of `.catch`. This is because if you forget to use `.catch`, errors disappear into the ether.

<Rule>
  Use try/catch instead of .catch
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
fruit.ripe().catch((err) => {
  ...
});

// Good:
try {
  await fruit.ripe();
} catch (err) {
  ...
}
```

### Series execution

Use the `await` flag to wait for each function to finish.

```ts
const data1 = await doTask1();
const data2 = await doTask2();
```

### Parallel execution

Combine `await` with `Promise.all` for parallel execution.

```ts
const [
  data1,
  data2,
] = await Promise.all([
  doTask1(),
  doTask2(),
]);
```

### Callbacks

Refrain from using callbacks unless absolutely necessary. If it's a lib function that requires a callback, wrap it in a helper and then use the helper.

<Rule>
  Refrain from using callbacks. If a lib requires one, wrap and forget it
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
setTimeout(task, 1000);

// Good:
/**
 * Wait for a specific amount of time
 * @author Gabe Abrams
 * @param msToWait the number of ms to wait before continuing
 */
const waitFor = async (msToWait: number) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, msToWait);
  });
};

await waitFor(1000);
task();
```

# React

All our front-end development are done within the React framework. We pair our React apps with the following technologies:

- [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs) for Styling
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) for Glyphs

In favor of built-in React functionality, we do not use:

- Redux

We no longer use any of the following technologies:

- jQuery

Features to use only after a discussion with the team because these features require everyone to be on the same page:

- React Context Providers (useContext hook)

## Organize the Project

We organize our React projects with the following file structure:

```ts
client/src/
  index.tsx // Entry point
  App.tsx // Main component
  Menu.tsx // Non-shared component
  shared/
    styles/
      style.scss // Main shared stylesheet
    constants/
      MY_SHARED_CONSTANT.tsx // A shared constant
    helpers/
      mySharedHelper.tsx // A shared helper
    MySharedComponent.tsx // A shared component
  ...
```

## Create a Component

Each project will either use class-based or functional components, but will not mix and match. New projects will always use functional components. 

<Rule tall>
  Projects do not mix and match functional vs class-based components
</Rule>

<Rule tall>
  New projects use functional components only
</Rule>

All file management rules apply to components as well (naming conventions, file vs folder modules, etc.), so be sure to check out the section earlier in this guide.

All components must follow a shared structure. Sections that are not used may be left out, but any included sections must be formatted appropriately, named properly, and in the same order as below:

<Rule>
  Components must follow our template formatting, order, and naming
</Rule>

## Component Development Practices

The template above is highly involved, so let's break it down into pieces. Remember that you can leave any sections out if they are irrelevant. For example, if your component does not have any state, leave out the entire section.

Let's go from top to bottom.

### Documentation

We use JSDoc to document each file and every single function. Add one or more author tags to every single JSDoc entry.

Here's an example for a forgot password button:

```ts
/**
 * Button that shows the "forgot password" panel
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 */
```

<Rule tall>
  Add JSDoc to the top of every component file, describing the component
</Rule>

### Git Norms

**Commit frequently**. We will squash later, but it's nice to have a detailed history. Plus, this is great for your careers.

### CSS Units

We prefer **rem** for elements that have the same sizing, independent of their context (independent of their parent styling and size).

We prefer **em** for elements that have variable sizing where their sizing depends on their parent or context.

Why? When people customize their browser settings (fonts, font size, viewport settings, etc.) it will mess up your layout and create unexpected layouts. Plus, this makes your tool more accessible (it adapts better to user settings).

<Rule tall>
  Use rem or em units instead of px units
</Rule>

### Imports

We aggressively divide imports by type because components often end up with many imports.

First, we import libraries such as `react`. Then, we import any local files

<Rule>
  Import libraries before importing any local modules
</Rule>

```ts
// Import Lib
import Lib from 'lib';

// Import AnotherLib
import AnotherLib from 'another-lib';

// Import LocalModule
import LocalModule from 'local-module';
```

Additionally, we divide all local modules into categories. Up first are shared imports (items that are also imported by other modules), then we have non-shared imports (items that are not imported by any other module). We divide each of these into sub-categories: helpers, constants, types, and components.

<Rule>
  Group local imports
</Rule>

```ts
// Import shared helpers
import addHelperName from './addHelperFilename';

// Import shared constants
import ADD_CONSTANT_NAME from './addConstantFilename';

// Import shared types
import AddSharedTypeName from './AddSharedTypeFilename';

// Import shared components
import AddSharedComponentName from './AddSharedComponentFilename';

// Import helpers
import addHelperName from './addHelperFilename';

// Import constants
import ADD_CONSTANT_NAME from './addConstantFilename';

// Import types
import AddTypeName from './AddSharedTypeFilename';

// Import components
import AddComponentName from './AddComponentFilename';
```

Finally, always import resources (images, etc.) and stylesheets last. These are the only imports that can include file extensions.

<Rule>
  Import the stylesheet last
</Rule>

```ts
// Import style
import './AddNameOfStylesheet.scss';
```

<Rule tall>
  Only stylesheet and resource imports can include file extensions
</Rule>

### Types

The first type in your types section must always be your `Props` (if your component has any).

<Rule tall>
  Props must be at the top of the "Types" section
</Rule>

Remember that optional props must be marked with the `?` symbol. We put default props in the "Set Up" section inside of the component itself, so leave out the defaults here.

Example:

```ts
// Props definition
type Props = {
  // User's first name
  userFirstName: string,
  // User's last name
  userLastName: string,
  // True if the user is a teacher
  isTeacher?: boolean,
  // Handler for when the user wants to log in
  onLogInClicked?: () => void,
};
```

### Constants

All constants are named with all caps, words separated by underscores. We do this because the `const` keyword is ubiquitous throughout our code, so `const` does not always indicate that something is a module constant.

<Rule>
  Constants use ALL_CAPS_NAMING
</Rule>

```ts
// Duration of fade out animation
const FADE_OUT_DURATION = 1500; // ms
```

Remember that all numbers must include their units.

### State

You may be familiar with the React `useState` hook. We take a more rigorous approach to component state, always requiring that state be managed by reducers. This forces us to keep our views and controllers separate. Thus, we achieve a fully separate MVC design.

<Rule tall>
  Use reducers to manage state
</Rule>

For components that have different views, define a `View` enum and base state definitions on the view. In our example, the component is a checkout panel.

<Rule>
  Create a View enum for components that have more than one view
</Rule>

```ts
enum View {
  // View the cart
  Cart = 'Cart',
  // Add shipping and billing information
  ShippingAndBillingForm = 'ShippingAndBillingForm',
  // Review order details and confirm
  Review = 'Review',
}
```

Then, base the sate off of views. Each view should have a separate state definition.

```ts
type State = (
  | {
    // Current view
    view: View.Cart,
    // List of items that are in the cart
    cart: Items[],
  }
  | {
    // Current view
    view: View.ShippingAndBillingForm,
    // List of items that are being purchased
    cart: Items[],
    // Shipping information
    shippingInformation: {
      // Shipping address
      address: Address,
      // Delivery instructions
      deliveryInstructions: string,
      // Phone number
      phone: PhoneNumber,
    },
    // Billing information
    billingInformation: (
      | {
        // True if same as shipping information
        sameAsShippingInformation: true,
      }
      | {
        // True if same as shipping information
        sameAsShippingInformation: false,
        // Billing address
        address: Address,
        // Phone number
        phone: PhoneNumber,
      }
    ),
  }
  | {
    // Current view
    view: View.Review
    // Identifier of the pending transaction
    transactionId: string,
    // True if the user has accepted the terms
    termsAccepted: boolean,
  }
);
```

If the component only has one view, leave out the `View` enum and create a state that has only one form:

```ts
type State = {
  // List of email recipients
  recipients: EmailAddress[],
  // List of CC recipients
  ccRecipients?: EmailAddress[],
  // Text typed into the email subject line
  subject: string,
  // Text typed into the body of the email
  body: string,
  // True if the "sending" indicator is visible
  sending: boolean,
};
```

We use reducers to manage state. That means that all state updates are handled through actions. This helps us to abstract away state updates, and helps state updates to be more reusable.

First, we create an `ActionType` enum that defines all of the types of actions that can be dispatched.

<Rule>
  All actions must have a separate ActionType
</Rule>

```ts
// Types of actions
enum ActionType {
  // Add a recipient to the email
  AddRecipient = 'AddRecipient',
  // Update the subject of the email
  UpdateSubject = 'UpdateSubject',
  // Reset the entire email form
  ResetForm = 'ResetForm',
  // Show the "email is being sent" indicator
  ShowSendingIndicator = 'ShowSendingIndicator',
}
```

Then, define the type of each action object. If the action has any payload properties, give it a separate Action type definition. Then, group all actions that have no payload at the bottom into one shared type definition.

<Rule>
  Define every action type with payload separately, group payload-less actions
</Rule>

```ts
// Action definitions
type Action = (
  | {
    // Action type
    type: ActionType.AddRecipient,
    // Email address of the recipient
    recipient: EmailAddress,
  }
  | {
    // Action type
    type: ActionType.UpdateSubject,
    // New text in the subject line
    subject: string,
  }
  | {
    // Action type
    type: (
      ActionType.ResetForm
      | ActionType.ShowSendingIndicator
    ),
  }
);
```

Finally, create a reducer that executes the state updates. This function can get quite involved, so remember to keep it very organized. If using the spread operator (`...`) to merge state, always put `...state` as the first element in the list so properties are overwritten.

```ts
/**
 * Reducer that executes actions
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 * @param state current state
 * @param action action to execute
 */
const reducer = (state: State, action: Action): State => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ActionType.AddRecipient: {
      return {
        ...state,
        recipients: [...state.recipients, action.recipient],
      };
    }
    case ActionType.UpdateSubject: {
      return {
        ...state,
        subject: action.subject,
      };
    }
    case ActionType.ResetForm: {
      return {
        recipients: [],
        ccRecipients: [],
        subject: '',
        body: '',
        sending: false,
      };
    }
    case ActionType.ShowSendingIndicator: {
      return {
        ...state,
        sending: true,
      };
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};
```

Switch statements in Typescript (and Javascript) share a block scope, so it can get very confusing to reason about logic. Thus, we wrap each case in a closure.

<Rule>
  Switch cases must be wrapped in curly brace closures
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    ...
  case value2:
    ...
  default:
    ...
}

// Good:
switch (expression) {
  case value1: {
    ...
  }
  case value2: {
    ...
  }
  default: {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Static Helpers

If logic can be removed from the component because it does not depend on state or props, either create a small static helper or move the logic to another file and import it under "Import Helpers".

<Rule tall>
  Static helpers and imported helpers should not heavily rely on state or props
</Rule>

Otherwise, static helpers follow usual rules: add JSDoc, types, etc.

```ts
/**
 * Get time of day
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 * @param timezone timezone of the current user
 * @returns text describing the time of day
 */
const getTimeOfDay = (timezone: Timezone): string => {
  ...
};
```

### Component Setup

The first thing that happens inside the component function is labeled "Setup" and it contains initialization for the props and state.

First, destructure props and include default props directly inline.

```ts
// Destructure all props
const {
  name,
  email,
  age,
  isTeacher = false,
  profileColor = Color.Blue,
} = props;
```

Then, define the initial state. In this way, default props and state are right next to each other and easy to find.

```ts
// Initial state
const initialState: State = {
  isOnline: false,
};
```

Then, initialize the state and destructure all state variables that are shared amongst all forms of the state.

```ts
// Initialize state
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

// Destructure common state
const {
  isOnline,
} = state;
```

Finally, initialize refs (if you have any).

```ts
// Initialize refs
const inputElem = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

...

<input ref={inputElem} ...
```

To get the element attached to a ref, use `inputElem.current`.

### Lifecycle Functions

React programmers often speak about the "lifecycle" of a component. When a component first is included in the UI, we say that the component is "Mounted". Then, when the props or state change, we say that the component "Updated". Note that when the component first receives its props and state (during the mount step), we also consider this as an update. Finally, when the component leaves the UI, we say that the component is "Unmounted". We use three different types of lifecycle functions if we want to trigger code when one of these lifecycle states occurs.

#### Mount

To trigger code when the component mounts, we add a `useEffect(handler, [])` hook.

```ts
/**
 * Mount
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 */
useEffect(
  () => {
    // TODO: implement
  },
  [],
);
```

The "Mount" lifecycle function is great for running any asynchronous loading code (example: API request). If your code is asynchronous, wrap it in an anonymous async function. This trick works for any other lifecycle function, but we will only show it used here.

```ts
/**
 * Mount
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 */
useEffect(
  () => {
    (async () => {
      // Check if the user is online
      const { isOnline } = await getUserState();

      // Update the sate
      dispatch({
        type: ActionType.CHANGE_USER_STATUS,
        isOnline,
      });
    })();
  },
  [],
);
```

#### Update

To trigger code when a prop or state variable changes, we use a `useEffect(handler, [trigger])` hook. The trigger array can be one or more props and/or state variables that will cause the handler to be called. We recommend keeping your trigger array as concise as possible.

```ts
/**
 * Update (also called on mount)
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 */
useEffect(
  () => {
    // Play a "message received" sound
    audioPlayer.play(Sound.MessageReceived);
  },
  [messages],
);
```

If you need multiple different "Update" lifecycle functions with different triggers, add multiple "Update" functions, each with a different trigger array.

You may hear about another usage for the `useEffect` hook where the trigger array is left out completely: `useEffect(handler)`, which corresponds to a trigger that happens whenever _anything_ changes. Refrain from using this hook unless it's absolutely necessary. Usually, if you want to use this hook, that means that either you are doing logic that will need to happen every render (so it might as well be part of the render function), or your logic doesn't need to be run that frequently (so you should be more careful with when your logic runs, which you do by adding a trigger array).

<Rule tall>
  Always include a trigger array with the useEffect hook
</Rule>

#### Unmount

To trigger code when a component leaves the UI, we return a handler function within a `useEffect(handler, [])` hook. This is a great lifecycle function for cleanup.

```ts
/**
 * Unmount
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 */
useEffect(
  () => {
    return () => {
      // Save the user's changes
      saveChanges();
    };
  },
  [],
);
```

### Render

You may have noticed that we separate sections of our code with comment blocks. Aside from the usual very large and wide comment block delimiting sections of the code, we use two smaller types of comment blocks to organize our render functions.

Medium blocks to separate parts of the UI:

```ts
/*----------------------------------------*/
/* ---------------- Modal --------------- */
/*----------------------------------------*/
```

And line comments to organize different types of that part of the UI:

```ts
/* ----------- Error Modal ---------- */
```

```ts
/* ------- Confirmation Modal ------- */
```

<Rule tall>
  Use comment blocks and lines to organize render code
</Rule>

When rendering views, it is okay to use `if` statements along with the `view` state variable (instead of `if` `else if` logic) because this keeps our code separate and readable.

At the end of the component's render code, there should be just one return statement that returns the main UI.

<Rule>
  Components can have only one return statement
</Rule>

```tsx
/*----------------------------------------*/
/* --------------- Main UI -------------- */
/*----------------------------------------*/

return (
  <div className="EmailForm-outer-container">
    {/* Add Modal */}
    {modal}

    {/* Add Body */}
    {body}
  </div>
);
```

### Wrap Up

This final section is usually very short. Put any final export logic here.

```ts
// Export component
export default EmailForm;
```

<Rule tall>
  Default export must happen at the end of the file on one line
</Rule>

<Rule>
  Default export cannot directly export a value
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
export default 50;

// Bad:
export default {
  ...
};

// Good:
export default myVariableName;

// Good:
export default MyClass;
```

## Writing JSX

Writing JSX code takes some getting used to. In many cases, it looks and feels just like HTML, but on certain cases, it differs in very small ways. Let's go through JSX by reviewing some of my favorite tips.

### Classes

Instead of using `class="..."`, we use `className="..."` in JSX.

### Events

In HTML, event handlers are named in all lowercase like `onmousedown` but in JSX, we use camel case like `onMouseDown`.

### Spaces in JSX

To add a normal breaking space, use `{' '}` on its own line.

To add a non-breaking space, use `&nbsp;`.

### Quotes and Other Symbols

To keep our JSX clean and to help with rendering, we always encode symbols.

<Rule tall>
  Always encode symbols in JSX
</Rule>

Here are a few for reference:

- `&` becomes `&amp;`
- `<` becomes `&lt;`
- `>` becomes `&gt;`
- `"` becomes `&quot;`
- `'` becomes `&apos;`
- `Â¢` becomes `&cent;`
- `Â©` becomes `&copy;`
- `Â®` becomes `&reg;`

### Modals

All modals should be `dce-reactkit` modals with unique keys.

<Rule>
  All modals must have unique keys
</Rule>

```ts
<Modal
  key="unique-modal-key"
  ...
/>
```

### FontAwesome Icons

To add a FontAwesome icon, make sure the icon is imported. For example, if we want a checkmark, we will import the `faCheck` icon:

```ts
// Import FontAwesome
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';
import { faCheck } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';
```

Usually, icon names are just the camelCase versions of the icon name, but autocomplete should help you here.

Then, when you want to use the icon, include it like this:

```html
<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCheck} />
```

You can also add a `className` prop to `FontAwesomeIcon` for bootstrap styles:

```html
<FontAwesomeIcon
  icon={faCheck}
  className="m-2"
/>
```

### Self-closing Tags

In HTML, you may see a tag that has no contents:

```html
<div id="LoginButton-container"></div>
```

...but in JSX, we use self-closing tags:

```tsx
<div id="LoginButton-container" />
```

<Rule tall>
  Use self-closing tags for elements with no children
</Rule>

## Dispatching Actions

We spent a lot of time defining the state and reducer, but how do you dispatch an action to the reducer?

Simple: call the `dispatch` function and pass an object with a `type` property and any other payload properties that are defined for that action type.

```ts
dispatch({
  type: ActionType.UpdateSubject,
  subject: inputField.value,
});
```

## Design Principles

### Prefer Multiline Representations

Unless something in JSX has just one item, put it on multiple lines. This keeps our UI code very clean and readable.

<Rule>
  Prefer multiline JSX
</Rule>

```tsx
{/* Good */}
<div id="LoginButton-container" />

{/* Equally Good */}
<div
  id="LoginButton-container"
/>

{/* Bad */}
<div id="LoginButton-container" className="row" />

{/* Good */}
<div
  id="LoginButton-container"
  className="row"
/>
```

### One Language Per Line

In JSX file, we mix and match typescript and html code.

Unless you're embedding a single variable:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={handleClick}
  ...
```

...or you're embedding a single value:

```tsx
<button
  type="button"
  ...
```

...don't mix and match typescript and html code on the same line.

<Rule>
  Don't mix typescript and JSX
</Rule>

```tsx
{/* Bad: */}
<button
  onClick={() => { handleClick(); }}
  ...
/>

{/* Good: */}
<button
  onClick={() => {
    handleClick();
  }}
  ...
/>

{/* Bad: */}
<div className="Role-description">
  You are a {user.role} in the course.
</div>

{/* Good: */}
<div className="Role-description">
  You are a
  {' '}
  {user.role}
  {' '}
  in the course
</div>
```

### Shared State

If state must be shared between multiple components, put those state variables in the lowest common ancestor and pass state down to children via props.

This can cause what is called "prop drilling", where state is passed through multiple layers of children via their props. If this becomes particularly cumbersome, it might be one of the cases where we use a React Context Provider to create a shared state, but this needs to be a full team decision.

<Rule tall>
  Never create a React Context Provider without a discussion with your manager and the rest of the team
</Rule>

### No Images

Unless absolutely necessary, never use images. Great alternatives are glyphs via `FontAwesome` or svg vector graphics. If you think that an image is required, ask your manager before continuing. We do this to aggressively keep our apps small in size. We have students all over the world, many with very slow internet connections, so load time is very important.

<Rule tall>
  Never use an image without permission from your manager
</Rule>

### "Fat" Reducers

You'll often hear the term "fat" vs "thin" reducers, which refers to whether logic is concentrated inside the reducer or outside the reducer, respectively. We love "fat" reducers. As much as possible, move logic into the reducer. In my opinion, "thin" reducers defeat the entire purpose of reducers. When writing "thin" reducers, you often create an entire action that just passes through state updates. In this case, you lose all of the benefits of abstraction that `useReducer` offers and you might as well just replace it with `useState`.

## Constant Modules

If you have shared constants, put them in a `constants/` folder either in `client/src/shared/` if they're shared across the whole app or put them directly in the folder for the current component if they're shared across a component and its children.

Constant modules are simple:

```tsx
// MAX_STUDENTS_PER_TABLE.tsx

/**
 * Maximum number of students allowed at a table
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 */
const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_TABLE = 500; // people

export default MAX_STUDENTS_PER_TABLE;
```

## Enum or Types Modules

If you have shared enums or types, put them in a `types/` folder either in `client/src/shared/` if they're shared across the whole app or put them directly in the folder for the current component if they're shared across a component and its children.

Type modules are simple:

```tsx
// Car.tsx

/**
 * Car type
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 */
type Car {
  // Company that made the car
  make: string,
  // Year that the car was manufactured
  year: number,
  // Color of the car
  color: AllowedColors,
}

export default Car;
```

Enum modules are simple:

```tsx
// AllowedColors.tsx

/**
 * Allowed paint colors for new cars
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 */
enum AllowedColors {
  Red = 'Red',
  Green = 'Green',
  Blue = 'Blue',
}

export default AllowedColors;
```

It seems like a lot of word to re-type the name of enum values in lowercase, but we do that for a good reason: it helps with readable serialization and database entries that are more debuggable and readable. Because this is so valuable, we require it.

<Rule>
  Enums must have string value unless the value's natural type is a number
</Rule>

```ts
// Bad:
enum AllowedColors {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue,
}

// Good:
enum AllowedColors {
  Red = 'Red',
  Green = 'Green',
  Blue = 'Blue',
}

// Bad (allowed colors are not numbers)
enum AllowedColors {
  Red = 1,
  Green = 2,
  Blue = 3,
}

// Good (number of wheels is a number naturally)
enum VehicleWheelConfig {
  Bike = 2,
  Tricycle = 3,
  Car = 4,
  FlatbedTruck = 16,
}
```

## Helper Modules

If you have shared helpers, put them in a `helpers/` folder either in `client/src/shared/` if they're shared across the whole app or put them directly in the folder for the current component if they're shared across a component and its children.

Simply define the function and then export it.

```ts
// roundToTwoDecimals.tsx

/**
 * Round a number to two decimals
 * @author Divardo Calicci
 * @param num the number to round
 * @returns the rounded number
 */
const roundToTwoDecimals = (num: number) => {
  return (
    Math.round(
      num * 100
    )
    / 100
  );
};

export default roundToTwoDecimals;
```

### Use Bootstrap As Much As Possible

If Bootstrap has a class for the style or layout that you want to use, take advantage of Bootstrap. Check out the [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/). They're great.

But if you must create a new style, put it in an associated `.scss` file. If that style is shared, see the next section on "Shared Styles"

## Shared Styles

If you have shared styles, put them in a `styles/` folder either in `client/src/shared/` if they're shared across the whole app or put them directly in the folder for the current component if they're shared across a component and its children.

Great candidates for these styles are:

- Shared classes like `btn-nostyle`
- Shared custom color variables
- Shared custom number variables

Generally, we try to limit the number of shared style because we use Bootstrap so much. But, as a team, we may put some shared styles into a `client/src/shared/styles/style.scss` file.

To import a stylesheet that includes variables that you'd like to use, do it with the `@use` command:

```scss
@use '../shared/styles/style.scss';
```

When defining variables, do so at the top of your scss file:

```scss
$border-width: 0.5rem;
```

# Logging

To improve our tools, inform teaching practices, and provide analytics to faculty and staff, we log user errors and actions. Because logging is done so commonly, we use a common logging service from `dce-reactkit`.

## Preparation

### Connect to DB

In your app, make sure you've followed [instructions on setting up connections to the database](#mongodocdb). Then, add another "Log" collection to your `/server/src/shared/helpers/mongo.ts` file:

Import `dce-reactkit` dependencies at the top of the file:

```ts
// Import dce-reactkit
import { initLogCollection, Log } from 'dce-reactkit';
```

Initialize the log collection near the bottom of the file:

```ts
// Logs
export const logCollection = initLogCollection(Collection) as Collection<Log>;
```

And as always, whenever you make a change to this file, increment the `schemaVersion` variable.

Then, in the server index of your app, initialize `dce-reactkit` by importing the appropriate dependencies near the top:

```ts
// Import CACCL
import initCACCL, { getLaunchInfo } from 'caccl/server';

// Import dce-reactkit
import { initServer } from 'dce-reactkit';

// Import log collection
import { logCollection } from './shared/helpers/mongo';
```

Then, within the `initCACCL`, at the top of the `express.postprocessor` function, add code to initialize `dce-reactkit` with logging:

```ts
const main = async () => {
  // Initialize CACCL
  await initCACCL({
    ...
    express: {
      postprocessor: (app) => {
        // Initialize dce-reactkit
        initServer({
          app,
          getLaunchInfo,
          logCollection,
        });

        ...
      },
    },
  });
};
...
```

### Log Organization

Now that you've set up support for logging, take some time to think through how you want to organize the logs. We'll always divide logs into `error` and `action` logs, where `action` logs contain user actions such as opening panels, clicking buttons, interacting with elements, etc. It's up to you how you want to organize your action logs.

We'll be curating a `/server/src/shared/types/LogMetadata.ts` file (that should be synched to the client as well) that will hold all of the reusable log organization metadata (which you will learn about in later sections). Add an empty file to get started:

```ts
/**
 * Log contexts, tags, and other metadata
 * @author Your Name
 */
const LogMetadata = {
  // TODO: add metadata
};

export default LogMetadata;
```

There are two ways you will organize your logs:

#### Context and Subcontext

Each action log entry must be tied to a "context" and can optionally be tied to a "subcontext" as well. You may choose for contexts to represent features in your app, where subcontexts represent subfeatures. Or perhaps contexts represent pages/panels in your app. Or perhaps contexts represent different parts of a toolbox.

Once you've determined how you want to structure your contexts and subcontexts, add a section to the `LogMetadata.ts` file. Add each context to the `LogMetadata.Context` object as a string key where the value of each key matches the key itself:

```ts
/**
 * Log contexts, tags, and other metadata
 * @author Your Name
 */
const LogMetadata = {
  // Contexts
  Context: {
    AttendancePanel: 'AttendancePanel',
    AnalyticsDashboard: 'AnalyticsDashboard',
    Roster: 'Roster',
  },
};

export default LogMetadata;
```

If your app will make use of subcontexts, simply nest the context object and move the string value to an inner key called `_` that is placed at the top of the list of children. In the following example, we have subcategories within "AnalyticsDashboard" that represent different views inside of the analytics dashboard: "StudentView", "ClassView", and "ProgramView".

```ts
/**
 * Log contexts, tags, and other metadata
 * @author Your Name
 */
const LogMetadata = {
  // Contexts
  Context: {
    AttendancePanel: 'AttendancePanel',
    AnalyticsDashboard: {
      _: 'AnalyticsDashboard',
      StudentView: 'StudentView',
      ClassView: 'ClassView',
      ProgramView: 'ProgramView',
    },
    Roster: 'Roster',
  },
};

export default LogMetadata;
```

However you choose to organize your logs, make sure you future-proof your structure so that it can grow as your app changes. It's not fun to have to go back through old log entries and perform migrations. Instead, it's best to create future-proofed contexts and subcontexts that can be augmented and expanded. To better understand future-proofing, let's discuss an example: you are working on an app called "Math Toolbox" and you anticipate that it'll eventually have lots of sub-tools with different purposes. Currently, you've only created the "Calculator" subtool.

Here's an example of poor organization where contexts are not future-proofed:

```ts
/**
 * Log contexts, tags, and other metadata
 * @author Your Name
 */
const LogMetadata = {
  // Contexts
  Context: {
    Algebra: 'Algebra',
    Calculus: 'Calculus',
    Graphing: 'Graphing',
  },
};

export default LogMetadata;
```

Each context (Algebra, Calculus, Graphing) represents one part of the current calculator app. This will become really confusing and cluttered as more tools get added to our Math Toolbox tool. Perhaps the next tool will be a data science tool or a visualization tool. When more tools get added to our Math Toolbox, our context space will get more cluttered and it'll be hard to tell which context belongs to each tool. Plus, if other tools in our Math Toolbox have similar functions (perhaps the data science tool also has a graphing function), then we would have to add another context for that other tool and we'd have to give it a confusing name like `GraphingForDataScience`.

Here's a slightly improved way to organize contexts, but even this is not good enough:

```ts
/**
 * Log contexts, tags, and other metadata
 * @author Your Name
 */
const LogMetadata = {
  // Contexts
  Context: {
    CalculatorAlgebra: 'CalculatorAlgebra',
    CalculatorCalculus: 'CalculatorCalculus',
    CalculatorGraphing: 'CalculatorGraphing',
  },
};

export default LogMetadata;
```

In the example above, at least it's clear which tool each context belongs to, but it'll still be too cluttered as we further develop the tool.

Here's an example of good future-proofing:

```ts
/**
 * Log contexts, tags, and other metadata
 * @author Your Name
 */
const LogMetadata = {
  // Contexts
  Context: {
    Calculator: {
      _: 'Calculator',
      Algebra: 'Algebra',
      Calculus: 'Calculus',
      Graphing: 'Graphing',
    },
  },
};

export default LogMetadata;
```

### Tags

Another way you can organize logs is through tags. These tags are flexible, optional, and very simple. You decide which tags to use for your app. The main thing to think about is clutter-reduction. In particular, it's easy to create an endless list of tags that are confusing and sometimes indistinguishable from each other.

If you choose to use tags, once you've decided on a list of tags, add them to your `LogMetadata.ts` file:

```ts
// Import dce-reactkit
import { LogMetadataType } from 'dce-reactkit';

/**
 * Log contexts, tags, and other metadata
 * @author Your Name
 */
const LogMetadata = {
  // Contexts
  ...
  // Tags
  Tag: {
    StudentFeature: 'StudentFeature',
    TeacherFeature: 'TeacherFeature',
    AdminFeature: 'AdminFeature',
    PilotFeature: 'PilotFeature',
    RequiresLogin: 'RequiresLogin',
    RequiresRegistration: 'RequiresRegistration',
  },
};

export default LogMetadata;
```

### Log Levels

Each log entry is assigned a "log level" which determines the type of information the log contains. For example, "warn" level logs contain critical information, "info" level logs contain normal user story information, and "debug" level logs contain highly detailed information that might be necessary for fine-grained tracking or debugging.

By default, log entries are assigned the "info" log level. If you want to use another log level, simply pass it in while logging as `level`:

```ts
logServerEvent({
  ...
  level: LogLevel.Warn,
});
```

Where `LogLevel` can be imported from `dce-reactkit`:

```ts
// Import dce-reactkit
import { LogLevel } from 'dce-reactkit';
```

### Metadata

If context, subcontext, and tags aren't enough, you can add custom metadata individually to each log entry. The intent of the metadata field is to allow complicated actions or errors to provide additional information about the event. The metadata field should be an object with string keys and simple values (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) but the metadata field is not intended for large amounts of data (images, etc.)

To add metadata to a log entry, simply pass it in while logging as `metadata`:

```ts
logServerEvent({
  ...
  metadata: {
    my: 28,
    custom: 'metadata',
    can: 'have',
    any: {
      format: 'I want',
    },
  },
});
```

Where `metadata` can be any JSON object, however, we do prefer shallow metadata for easier querying.

### Automatically Added Organization

Whenever you log using `dce-reactkit`, a whole bunch of useful data is added to each log entry:

#### User Information

Every log entry will automatically include the following user information taken directly from the user's Canvas info:

```ts
{
  // First name of the user
  userFirstName: string,
  // Last name of the user
  userLastName: string,
  // User email
  userEmail: string,
  // User Canvas Id
  userId: number,
  // If true, the user is a learner
  isLearner: boolean,
  // If true, the user is an admin
  isAdmin: boolean,
  // If true, the user is a ttm
  isTTM: boolean,
}
```

#### Course Information

Every log entry will automatically include the following course information taken directly from the current Canvas course:

```ts
{
  // The id of the Canvas course that the user launched from
  courseId: number,
  // The name of the Canvas course
  courseName: string,
}
```

#### Device and Browser Information

Every log entry will automatically include the following course information taken from the user's session information:

```ts
{
  // Browser info
  browser: {
    // Name of the browser
    name: string,
    // Version of the browser
    version: string,
  },
  // Device info
  device: {
    // Name of the operating system
    os: string,
    // If true, device is a mobile device
    isMobile: boolean,
  },
}
```

#### Date and Time

Every log entry will automatically include the following date and time information, recorded in ET where applicable:

```ts
{
  // Calendar year that the event is from
  year: number,
  // Month that the event is from (1 = Jan, 12 = Dec)
  month: number,
  // Day of the month that the event is from
  day: number,
  // Hour of the day (24hr) when the event occurred
  hour: number,
  // Minute of the day when the event occurred
  minute: number,
  // Timestamp of event (ms since epoch)
  timestamp: number,
}
```

#### Error Source

If the log entry was created on the client, the entry will automatically include the following source flag:

```ts
{
  // Source of the event
  source: LogSource.Client,
}
```

Where `LogSource` can be found in `dce-reactkit`.

If the log entry was created on the server, the entry will automatically include the following source flag:

```ts
{
  // Source of the event
  source: LogSource.Server,
  // Route path (e.g. /api/admin/courses/53450/blocks)
  routePath: string,
  // Route template (e.g. /api/admin/courses/:courseId/blocks)
  routeTemplate: string,
}
```

Where route information is taken from express.

## Writing Logs

First, let's go over all the cases where logs are already automatically written. Whenever the `renderErrorPage` function is called from within an endpoint, that will automatically be logged. Also, whenever an error is thrown on the server from within an endpoint, that error will also automatically be logged.

To write your own logs, all you need to do is call the appropriate logging function. On the client, simply import the `logClientEvent` function from `dce-reactkit` and call it:

```ts
// Import dce-reactkit
import { logClientEvent } from 'dce-reactkit';

...

logClientEvent({
  ...
});
```

If you're on the server, from within an endpoint that is using the `genEndpointHandler` function, destructure the `logServerEvent` function from the handler's arguments and call it:

```ts
app.post(
  '/api/my/endpoint/path',
  genRouteHandler({
    ...
    handler: async ({ logServerEvent }) => {
      ...
      logServerEvent({
        ...
      });
```

Both the `logServerEvent` and `logClientEvent` functions take the same arguments. Thus, the process of logging on the server is identical to the process of logging on the client. See the section below depending on which type of log youâ€™re making (error or action):

### Logging Errors

To log errors, call `logServerEvent` or `logClientEvent` with an "error" argument which is an Error instance:

```ts
logClientEvent({
  context: LogMetadata.Context.AnalyticsDashboard,
  error: myError,
});
```

You can also add any or all of the following: subcontext, tags, level (log level), and/or metadata:

```ts
logClientEvent({
  context: LogMetadata.Context.AnalyticsDashboard,
  error: myError,
  subcontext: LogMetadata.Context.AnalyticsDashboard.StudentView,
  tags: [LogMetadata.Tag.RequiresLogin],
  level: LogLevel.Debug,
  metadata: {
    userHasPopupBlocker: true,
  },
});
```

Where `LogLevel` can be imported from `dce-reactkit`: `import { LogLevel } from 'dce-reactkit';`.

We automatically record `error.message`, `error.code`, and `error.stack`. If you want to manually determine those, try creating a `new ErrorWithCode`:

```ts
// Import dce-reactkit
import { ErrorWithCode } from 'dce-reactkit';

...

const error = new ErrorWithCode(
  'Add a message here',
  ErrorCode.MyErrorCode,
);
```

When querying logs, note that error information is spread out across three variables for simplicity:

```ts
{
  // The error message
  errorMessage: string,
  // The error code
  errorCode: string,
  // Error stack trace
  errorStack: string,
}
```

### Logging Actions

An action is any event that is either triggered by a user or is encountered by a user. To log actions, call `logServerEvent` or `logClientEvent` with an `action` and an optional `target` argument. If the action is being performed on the context itself (for example, the user is opening the AnalyticsDashboard), then the target should be left blank. Otherwise, the target should be included and should be a target taken directly from `LogMetadata.Target`. For a full list of available types of actions, see the list of [dce-reactkit log actions](https://github.com/harvard-edtech/dce-reactkit/blob/main/src/types/LogAction.ts).

Example of opening the context:

```ts
// Import dce-reactkit
import { LogAction } from 'dce-reactkit';

...

logServerEvent({
  context: LogMetadata.Context.AnalyticsDashboard,
  action: LogAction.Open,
});
```

Example of doing an action within a context:

```ts
// Import dce-reactkit
import { LogAction } from 'dce-reactkit';

...

logServerEvent({
  context: LogMetadata.Context.AnalyticsDashboard,
  action: LogAction.Remove,
  target: LogMetadata.Target.WatchSpeedWidget,
});
```

As with errors, you can add more information to your action log entry by adding a subcontext, tags, level (log level), and/or metadata:

```ts
logClientEvent({
  context: LogMetadata.Context.AnalyticsDashboard,
  subcontext: LogMetadata.Context.AnalyticsDashboard.StudentView,
  action: LogAction.Remove,
  target: LogMetadata.Target.WatchSpeedWidget,
  tags: [
    LogMetadata.Tag.PilotFeature,
    LogMetadata.Tag.AdminFeature,
  ],
  level: LogLevel.Warn,
  metadata: {
    analyticsInHighContrastMode: false,
  },
});
```

Where `LogLevel` can be imported from `dce-reactkit`: `import { LogLevel } from 'dce-reactkit';`.

## Querying Logs

There are many ways to query the logs, but here are some tips:

### Filter by Type

Take a look at the included [dce-reactkit log types](https://github.com/harvard-edtech/dce-reactkit/blob/main/src/types/LogType.ts) and filter by one of those. For example, if querying for just actions, use this query:

```ts
{ type: 'action' }
```

### Filter by User, Course, or Role

Use `userId`, `userEmail`, `userFirstName`, and/or `userLastName` to filter to a specific user.

Use `courseId` and/or `courseName` to filter to a specific course.

Use `isLearner`, `isAdmin`, or `isTTM` to filter to specific user roles.

### Filter by Source

You can filter by where the error occurred (on the server, on the client, etc.) by taking a look at the included [dce-reactkit sources](https://github.com/harvard-edtech/dce-reactkit/blob/main/src/types/LogSource.ts). For example, if querying for server-side errors, use this query:

```ts
{ source: 'server' }
```

### Filter by Date and/or Time

You can use the `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, etc. fields to query. For example, if we know that the issue occurred in January or February of 2023:

```ts
{
  year: 2023,
  month: { $in: [1, 2] },
}
```

### Filter by Action Type

If searching through action logs, you can take a look at the included [dce-reactkit action types](https://github.com/harvard-edtech/dce-reactkit/blob/main/src/types/LogAction.ts). For example, if you just want to find Open/Close/Cancel actions:

```ts
{
  action: {
    $in: ['open', 'close', 'cancel'],
  },
}
```

### Combining Filters

As usual, you can combine any of the example filters above while also adding your own custom filters to your query. For example, here's a query to find all client-side errors that students experienced in 2022:

```ts
{
  year: 2022,
  isLearner: true,
  source: 'client',
  type: 'error',
}j
```

# Express Server

## Why Express?

All of our React apps are served with an Express backend. This is a very intentional decision because it allows us to fluidly move items between the front-end and the back-end. This is possible because Express runs typescript in the same way as our React clients, plus all our dependencies can be added to either the server or the client. Finally, it allows us to share types across our server and client, instead of having to re-define them and manage two sets of types. None of this would be possible if we use a non-express, non-typescript backend (django, java, etc.).

If your app requires a server, it _must_ use Express.

## Dependencies

Make sure `caccl`, `dotenv`, and `dce-reactkit` are added to your project dependencies.

## Setting up Server

In the top-level `/server/src/index.ts` file, make sure you have the following key components of initialization:

```
// Import CACCL
import initCACCL, { getLaunchInfo } from 'caccl/server';

// Import dce-reactkit
import { initServer } from 'dce-reactkit';

// Import environment
import 'dotenv/config';

// Import route adders
import addRoutes from './addRoutes';

/**
 * Initialize app server
 * @author Your Name
 */
const init = async () => {
  // Initialize CACCL
  await initCACCL({
    express: {
      postprocessor: (app) => {
        // Initialize dce-reactkit
        initServer({
          getLaunchInfo,
        });

        // Call route adders
        addRoutes(app);
      },
    },
  });
};

// Init server and display errors
init();
```

## Server Folder Structure

All servers should generally follow this structure from within the `/server/src/` folder:

```
/index.ts â€“ the main server file, described above
/addRoutes/index.ts â€“ a script that calls all route adders
/addRoutes/addSomeTypeOfRoutes.ts â€“ adds one type of routes (e.g. student API routes)
/addRoutes/addAnotherTypeOfRoutes.ts â€“ adds one type of routes (e.g. teacher API routes)
```

Shared files go into the `/server/src/shared/` folder:

```
/constants/
/helpers/
/types/
/classes/
/interfaces/
```

<Rule tall>
  Use the server folder structure above
</Rule>

## Adding API Endpoints and Other Routes

In each server, there should be a `/server/src/addRoutes` module that contains all routes. Divide routes into sensible categories, and put them in a nested tree structure such that the top-level `index.ts` file only needs to call one route adder: `/server/src/addRoutes/index.ts`.

For example, let's say you have an app where there are really three types of routes: student API routes, teaching team member (TTM) API routes, and admin API routes. Within TTM routes, that is further subdivided into two sub-categories: teacher routes and TA routes. Thus, we'd divide our routes into the following folder structure:

```
/addRoutes/index.ts â€“ a route adder function that calls all route adder subfolders
/addRoutes/addStudentAPIRoutes.ts â€“ adds all student API routes
/addRoutes/addTTMAPIRoutes/index.ts â€“ calls all adder TTM adder functions
/addRoutes/addTTMAPIRoutes/addTeacherRoutes.ts â€“ adds all teacher routes
/addRoutes/addTTMAPIRoutes/addTARoutes.ts â€“ adds all teacher routes
/addRoutes/addAdminRoutes.ts â€“ adds all admin routes
```

### Standard Route Path Naming

We use REST API standards with additional constraints. When defining a route, always use the following rules to create your paths:

<Rule tall>
  All API endpoint paths must start with `/api`
</Rule>

Additionally, if only certain types of users can access the route, add another prefix for the type of user. Currently, we support `admin` and `ttm`:

<Rule tall>
  TTM API routes must start with `/api/ttm`, admin API routes must start with `/api/admin`
</Rule>

For the endpoint method, follow these rules:

- Get data = GET
- Create or add something = POST
- Multipurpose create *or* modify something = POST
- Single-purpose modify something = PUT
- Delete or remove something = DELETE

We use a folder-like pluralized path structure for endpoints. All placeholders must be prefixed by a description of the value.

<Rule tall>
  All placeholders must have a description prefix
</Rule>

For example, if you want to have a course id and a user id in the path, you must add prefixes:

```
Good:
/api/admin/courses/:courseId/users/:userId

Bad:
/api/admin/course/:courseId/user/:userId â€“ not pluralized
/api/admin/courses/:courseId/:userId â€“ userId has no prefix
/api/admin/:courseId/:userId â€“ neither course nor user ids have prefixes
```

Add routes directly to the express app (for consistency across projects):

```ts
app.get(
  '/api/ttm/videos/:videoId/transcripts/:transcriptId',
  [handler here],
);
```

<Rule tall>
  Every endpoint must be documented using JSDoc
</Rule>

Add a JSDoc block above each endpoint, making sure to describe as `@param` statements any parameters that are _not_ included in the URL. For example, if we have an endpoint with two parameters in the url (`videoId` and `transcriptId`) and two parameters included in the request (`format` and `language`), the JSDoc would look like this:

```ts
/**
 * Get the transcript for a video
 * @author Gabe Abrams
 * @param {string} format the format of the transcript to return
 * @param {string} [language=en] the language to use for the transcript
 * @returns {string} full video transcript
 */
app.get(
  '/api/ttm/videos/:videoId/transcripts/:transcriptId',
  [handler here],
);
```

All API routes should use the `dce-reactkit` function for generating a route handler: `genRouteHandler`, which handles auth, session management, security and privacy, parameter parsing, automatic error handling, crash prevention, and so much more.

<Rule tall>
  API route handlers should use "genRouteHandler" from dce-reactkit if possible
</Rule>

The second argument of the express `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, `app.delete`, or `app.all` function is a route handler. Use `genRouteHandler` to create such a handler.

`genRouteHandler` takes one argument, which is an object that must contain a `handler` function, may optionally contain a `paramTypes` map defining the types of parameters, and may optionally contain a flag that turns off the session check. Each property is defined below:

#### genRouteHandler: paramTypes

Define all params that the user can include in the request, including params in the URL and params in the request body. For example, if we have an endpoint with two parameters in the url (`videoId` and `transcriptId`) and two parameters included in the request (`format` and `language`), the `paramTypes` object should look like this:

```ts
app.get(
  '/api/ttm/videos/:videoId/transcripts/:transcriptId',
  genRouteHandler({
    paramTypes: {
      videoId: ParamType.Int,
      transcriptId: ParamType.Int,
      format: ParamType.String,
      language: ParamType.String,
    },
    ...
  }),
);
```

We use the `dce-reactkit` special param type enum called `ParamType`, which supports the following types:

```ts
Boolean â€“ required boolean
BooleanOptional â€“ optional boolean
Float â€“  required float
FloatOptional â€“ optional float
Int â€“ required int
IntOptional â€“ optional int
JSON â€“ required JSON object that has been stringified
JSONOptional â€“ optional JSON object that has been stringified
String â€“ required string
StringOptional â€“ optional string
```

Note that it doesn't make sense to make a URL parameter be an optional param because they must always be included by construction.

#### genRouteHandler: handler function

The handler function is key because it handles the request. The handler function is an `async` function that is tasked with either returning the value that should be sent in the response to the client, or the handler function should throw an error which would also be sent to the client.

To send an error code to the client, use the `dce-reactkit` custom error called `ErrorWithCode`.

To send a response to the client, simply return the value that you want to send to the client. If you don't want to return anything, simply `return undefined;`.

Handler functions can take any of the following requirements, depending on what's required for the functionality you need to implement:

- `params`: a map containing all params defined in `paramTypes` plus a whole host of other automatically included user information. See the list below for more information
- `req`: the express request object
- `next`: a function to call to call the next express handler in the stack `next()`
- `send`: send a raw text response to the client `send(text: string, [status: number])`
- `renderErrorPage`: render a pretty html page that displays a server-side error (should not be used for API endpoint), takes an object that contain any of the following strings: `title`, `description`, `code`, `pageTitle`, as well as an optional `status` number

Additional params added to the `params` object in addition to params defined by `paramTypes`:

```ts
/**
 * Additional auto-included params:
 * @param {number} userId the user's CanvasId
 * @param {string} userFirstName the user's first name from Canvas
 * @param {string} userLastName the user's last name from Canvas
 * @param {string} userEmail the user's primary email from Canvas
 * @param {boolean} isLearner true if the user is a learner (student) in the Canvas course
 * @param {boolean} isTTM true if the user is a teacher, TA, or other teaching team member in the Canvas course
 * @param {boolean} isAdmin true if the user is a Canvas admin
 * @param {number} courseId the id of the Canvas course that the user launched from
 * @param {string} courseName the name of the Canvas course
 */
```

Further, all variables from the user's express session will be added to the params object if those variables are of type `string` or `boolean` or `number`.

Here's an example:

```ts
app.get(
  '/api/ttm/videos/:videoId/transcripts/:transcriptId',
  genRouteHandler({
    ...
    handler: async ({ params, next }) => {
      ...

      if (somethingBadHappened) {
        throw new ErrorWithCode(
          'Error message with full description here',
          'AX34', // Error code
        );
      }

      ...

      if (needToCallNextHandler) {
        return next();
      }

      ...

      // Process params and get transcript
      const {
        // Get request info
        videoId,
        transcriptId,
        format,
        language,
        // Get more info
        userId,
        userFirstName,
      } = params;

      // Get the transcript
      const transcript = getTranscript(videoId, transcriptId, format, language);

      // Add user info to the transcript
      const transcriptWithUserInfo = augmentWithUserInfo(transcript, userId, userFirstName);

      // Send the response to the client
      return transcriptWithUserInfo;
    },
    ...
  }),
);
```

#### genRouteHandler: skipSessionCheck

If `skipSessionCheck` is true, `dce-reactkit` will skip its usual session checks (user must have launched via LTI and must have a valid session).

## Mongo/DocDB

### When to Add a Database

We use databases intentionally. Thus, it's important to understand when to use a database, and when not to.

Comparing memory vs database storage:

| Factor | In Memory | In Database |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed | Quick to access | Slow to access |
| Permanence | Deleted upon instance restart | Stored indefinitely |
| Distribution | Data must only be relevant to one user during their session | Data can be shared across multiple sessions, across multiple users, or across multiple server instances |
| Migration | Automatically deleted when app is upgraded | Must be migrated when app is updated |
| Backups | Never backed up | Automatically backed up on regular intervals |
| Cleanup | If managed well, garbage collector takes care of this | Database will continue to grow if not managed carefully |

From this chart, it may seem like everything should go in a database, which is not necessarily true. Especially with user-specific information that is specific to the user's current session, it is extremely advantageous to store that information directly to the user's session (`req.session` via express) instead of storing items in the database. This minimizes the number of I/O lookups that have to occur on every server request.

Here are a few scenarios to consider:

- A piece of user-specific data needs to be quickly accessible by the user and is not needed after the user's session expires. We'll put this in the user's session because it'll be fast to access and will be automatically cleaned up after the user ends their session.
- A piece of data needs to be extremely quick to access because it must be used by server-side algorithms, but this data is also required outside the user's session. We'll store this in a database but cache it in memory, so we get the best of both worlds...but we'll be careful to think through the impact of caching and potentially out-of-date data.
- A piece of data needs to be stored indefinitely and we'll continue to add to it over time. We'll store this in the database because that'll ensure the data is persistent and backed up.
- A piece of data needs to be accessed by multiple users. We'll store this in the database.
- A piece of data is very large. We'll store this in the database because we simply cannot leave it in memory without risk of running out of memory once multiple users use this feature.

Once you've decided what data should be in the database and what data should not be in the database, you can continue to the following section to integrate with mongo/docdb.

### Integrating with Mongo/DocDB

Because our projects are designed to go back and forth seamlessly between MongoDB and Amazon DocDB, we use a library called `dce-mango` which provides the seamless interface that ensures operations are successfully executed and queries are consistently executed independent of the database type.

We _only_ use non-relational database because these types of databases work extremely fluently with the rest of our javascript-based stack. In particular, mongo and docdb allow us to store javascript objects directly to the database, with a couple constraints. Thus, wherever possible, try to create javascript objects that adhere to the following constraints so we can move those objects to a database if needed:

1. No circular objects (an object cannot contain cycles)
1. Only simple data in objects (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects) instead of complex objects (classes, interfaces, class instances, etc.)

If integrating with a database, create a shared helper called `/server/src/shared/helpers/mongo.ts` that contains all of the code defining each collection in the database. For each collection, define the typescript type for an entry that will be stored in said collection and put that type in `/server/src/shared/types/stored`.

I'll explain `dce-mango` through example. It is important that you follow the structure of this template. This includes formatting and headings.

First, import dependencies and the shared types associated with each collection:

```ts
// Import db
import { initMango, Collection } from 'dce-mango';

// Import shared types
import ActivitySubmission from '../types/stored/ActivitySubmission';
import ShareoutPost from '../types/stored/ShareoutPost';
import LiveMessage from '../types/stored/LiveMessage';
import LiveViewer from '../types/stored/LiveViewer';
import Migration from '../types/stored/Migration';
import WatchTrace from '../types/stored/WatchTrace';
```

Then, initialize `dce-mango`, giving it a schemaVersion (start at 1 and increment every time you make changes to this file):

```ts
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/* ----------------------------- Initialize ----------------------------- */
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

initMango({
  schemaVersion: 12,
  dbName: 'immersive-player-store',
});
```

Finally, define and export each collection. Define each collection by creating a new instance of the `Collection` class. Add in the type of the entries in the collection, using the associated type that you imported: `new Collection<MyEntryType>(...)`. The `Collection` constructor takes two arguments: the first argument is the name of the collection, which should be named the same as the entry type: `new Collection<MyEntryType>('MyEntryType', ...`. The second argument defines indexes, and takes the following parameters:

`uniqueIndexKey` â€“ a string that represents the key for the property to use as a unique index. If defined, each entry must have a unique value for this property. When inserting into a collection with a unique index, if an existing entry has a matching value for this key, the existing entry will be overwritten.

`indexKeys` â€“ a list of secondary non-unique keys that should be used to create other indexes. Here, simply provide a list of keys that will commonly be used for searching and querying. Don't get too carried away: for every key you add to this list, the database must maintain an index and must update the index when entries are added/modified/removed.

`expireAfterSeconds` â€“ a number of seconds that represents the minimum lifespan of entries in this collection. If not included, entries will not be automatically deleted. There is no guarantee that entries will be deleted immediately after they expire. Instead, regular cleanups occur and expired entries are deleted. 

<Rule tall>
  If entries have an id, always simply name it "id"
</Rule>

Remember to export each collection, as you see in the example:

```ts
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/* ----------------------------- Collections ---------------------------- */
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

// Activity Submissions
export const activitySubmissionCollection = new Collection<ActivitySubmission>(
  'ActivitySubmission',
  {
    uniqueIndexKey: 'id',
    indexKeys: [
      'courseId',
      'videoId',
      'isLearner',
      'isAdmin',
    ],
  },
);

// Shareout Post
export const shareoutPostCollection = new Collection<ShareoutPost>(
  'ShareoutPost',
  {
    uniqueIndexKey: 'id',
    indexKeys: [
      'courseId',
      'videoId',
      'isLearner',
      'isAdmin',
    ],
  },
);

// Migrations
export const migrationCollection = new Collection<Migration>(
  'Migration',
  {
    uniqueIndexKey: 'id',
    indexKeys: [
      'oldVideoId',
      'newVideoId',
      'migrationStatus',
    ],
  },
);

// Live messages
export const liveMessageCollection = new Collection<LiveMessage>(
  'LiveMessage',
  {
    uniqueIndexKey: 'id',
    indexKeys: [
      'courseId',
      'videoId',
      'timestamp',
      'isLearner',
      'isAdmin',
    ],
  },
);

// Live viewers
export const liveViewerCollection = new Collection<LiveViewer>(
  'LiveViewer',
  {
    uniqueIndexKey: 'id',
    indexKeys: [
      'courseId',
      'videoId',
      'timestamp',
      'isLearner',
      'isAdmin',
    ],
    expireAfterSeconds: 90,
  },
);

// Watch traces
export const watchTraceCollection = new Collection<WatchTrace>(
  'WatchTrace',
  {
    uniqueIndexKey: 'id',
    indexKeys: [
      'courseId',
      'videoId',
      'isLearner',
      'isAdmin',
    ],
  },
);
```

### Local Development

Once deployed to AWS, `dce-mango` will automatically connect to an auto-provisioned database, as long as the app is configured to have a dabase.

However, while developing your app and testing in a local dev environment, you'll need to have a test database. Ultimately, you'll need to "MONGO_URL" which you'll put in your `/server/.env` file:

```bash
MONGO_URL=mongodb://some/mongo-database-url-here
```

There are two recommended ways of provisioning your test database:

#### Get a free cloud-based mongodb instance

This option is best if you want a simple, flexible database that has a UI, and is easy to share across multiple systems. Gabe recommends this for all EdTech Software Engineers that report to them because it'll be easier for Gabe to jump in and run your code with your current database state.

1. Visit `cloud.mongodb.com`
1. Log in with your `g.harvard.edu` email
1. Create a new project
1. Get a free "Shared" tier database and place it in AWS N. Virginia
1. Create a Username and Password for your app
1. Allow access from anywhere by adding an IP to your IP Access List: IP Address = 0.0.0.0/0 and Description = Anywhere
1. Find the cluster (probably called "Cluster0") and click "Connect"
1. Click "Connect your application"
1. Copy down the "connection string" and replace "<username>" with the username, replace "<password>" with the password
1. Paste the url into your `/server/.env` file as "MONGO_URL"

#### Create a local mongodb cluster

This option is best if you're a pro and want complete control over your cluster. Also consider this option if you're storing sensitive data.

Find a tutorial online on how to provision a local mongodb cluster. Create a database within that cluster. For the sake of this example, let's call the database "my-app". Then, a url to your local cluster in your `/server/.env` file. It might look something like this:

```bash
MONGO_URL=mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/my-app
```

### Accessing and Modifying Data

Now that you've integrated with the database, you'll need to create, edit, delete, and query collections in the database. We'll walk through some asynchronous operations you can perform. Full documentation can be found via the typescript JSDoc embedded in the `dce-mango` library. We'll show a few examples.

In each example, we will pretend that we're integrating with a "Users" collection that contains objects that look like this:

```ts
// Type (saved to /server/src/shared/types/stored/User.ts)
type User = {
  // The user's unique id
  id: string,
  // The user's first name
  userFirstName: string,
  // The user's last name
  userLastName: string,
  // The user's email
  userEmail: string,
  // The user's current age
  age: number,
  // List of user's current addresses
  addresses: {
    type: ('home' | 'work' | 'other'),
    streetAddress: number,
    streetName: string,
    streetSuffix: ('st' | 'dr' | 'av' | 'pl' | 'rd'),
    cityName: string,
    zipCode: number,
    country: string,
  }[],
};

// Example user:
const user: User = {
  id: '1022',
  userFirstName: 'Gabe',
  userLastName: 'Abrams',
  userEmail: 'gabe_abrams@harvard.edu',
  age: 10,
  addresses: [
    {
      type: 'home',
      streetAddress: 13,
      streetName: 'Axis',
      streetSuffix: 'dr',
      cityName: 'Cambridge',
      zipCode: 02155,
      country: 'US',
    },
  ],
};
```

Before continuing, we need to describe a "query" object. This is used for searching the collection. You can think of a query as a partial object that is compared with every item in the collection. Any items that match the query will be returned/modified/deleted/etc. depending on the current operation. I'll explain with a few examples:

```ts
// Query that matches all users with a certain first name:
const query = {
  userFirstName: 'Kino',
};
```

```ts
// Query that matches all users with a certain age:
const query = {
  age: 14,
};
```

We support complex queries. You can google these, but generally, the way you use these is by putting an object in place of a value. Here are a few examples:

```ts
// Query that matches all users who are younger than 18
const query = {
  age: { $lt: 18 },
};
```

```ts
// Query that matches all users who are 10 or 20
const query = {
  age: { $in: [10, 20] },
};
```

To interact with the collection, simply import it at the top of your file:

```ts
import { userCollection } from '../../shared/helpers/mongo';
```

#### Find - Query/Search a Collection

Each find command searches a collection for _all_ matches to a query. If the returned array is empty, there are no matches to the query.

```ts
// Find all teenagers
const matches = await userCollection.find({
  age: { $gte: 13, $lt: 20 },
});
```

#### Increment - increment an integer propery of an object

To use this function, the collection must be uniquely indexed by a string "id" field. Simply pass in the id of the object and the property to increment.

```ts
// Increment a user's age by 1 year
await userCollection.increment('1022', 'age');
```

#### Update Prop Values - add or update values in an entry in the collection

For this to work, the object must already exist in the collection. Instead of overwriting the object, you can use this operation to perform a partial update, only modifying certain parts of the object. Pass in a query that will be used to find the object to update, then pass in an object containing the updates to apply.

```ts
// Set the addresses of all users with the last name "Abrams"
await userCollection.updatePropValues(
  {
    userLastName: 'Abrams',
  },
  {
    addresses: [
      {
        type: 'home',
        streetAddress: 13,
        streetName: 'Axis',
        streetSuffix: 'dr',
        cityName: 'Cambridge',
        zipCode: 02155,
        country: 'US',
      },
    ],
  },
);
```

#### Push - add an object to an array in an object

If there's an existing array in an object, you can use this function to add one more item to that array. To use this function, the collection must be uniquely indexed by a string "id" field. Simply pass in the id of the object, the property that points to the array, and the object to insert.

```ts
// Add an address to a specific user's addresses array
await userCollection.push(
  '1022',
  'addresses',
  {
    type: 'home',
    streetAddress: 13,
    streetName: 'Axis',
    streetSuffix: 'dr',
    cityName: 'Cambridge',
    zipCode: 02155,
    country: 'US',
  },
);
```

#### Filter Out - modify an array by filtering out all objects that don't match a comparison

If there's an existing array in an object, you can use this function to filter items out of an array. To use this function, the collection must be uniquely indexed by a string "id" field. Pass an object that contains the id, arrayProp, and a compareProp (the property inside of each array object to compare) and the compareValue (the value to filter out).

```ts
// Remove all US addresses from a user's addresses array
await userCollection.filterOut({
  id: '1022',
  arrayProp: 'addresses',
  compareProp: 'country',
  compareValue: 'US',
});
```

#### Insert - add an item to the collection

This one's simple: it'll insert an item into the collection. If the collection is uniquely indexed and an object already exists, the insert will be converted to an "upsert" which replaces the existing object automatically.

```ts
// Add a user to the db
await userCollection.insert({
  id: '1022',
  userFirstName: 'Gabe',
  userLastName: 'Abrams',
  userEmail: 'gabe_abrams@harvard.edu',
  age: 10,
  addresses: [
    {
      type: 'home',
      streetAddress: 13,
      streetName: 'Axis',
      streetSuffix: 'dr',
      cityName: 'Cambridge',
      zipCode: 02155,
      country: 'US',
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Delete - remove an item from the collection

This one's simple: it'll delete the first object that matches the query.

```ts
// Delete a user
await userCollection.delete({
  id: '1022',
});
```

# React Component Unit Tests

## Guiding Principles

We aim for high test coverage, but time is always limited, so we write tests in order of priority.

Here's our order of priority:

1. Main interactive components + key features
1. Edge cases
1. Features that have a higher chance of breaking later on
1. Everything else

There are some things that we do not test:

1. Implementation details: these will change
1. Specific look and feel (colors, etc.): these will change with themes

When writing tests, first write each assertion with the opposite type of test (if a button should be enabled, test if it's disabled) and make sure the test will fail. Writing tests that succeed is easy. Writing tests that fail when appropriate is very hard.

## Create a Test File

Name your test the same as your component with a `.test.tsx` filename:

<Rule>
  Tests use same name as component with .test.tsx extension
</Rule>

```ts
MyComponent.tsx // Component
MyComponent.test.tsx // Test
```

## Write a Test

First, import our testing library and the component to test:

```ts
// Import testing lib
import Raixa from 'raixa';

// Import component to test
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
```

We use a custom-built wrapper for [React Testing Library (RTL)](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) that we call [Raixa](bit.ly/dce-raixa). Although we do not directly interact with RTL, for your own professional development, we recommend that you take some time to learn it. But for our purposes, if a testing functionality is not available in [Raixa](bit.ly/dce-raixa), we will add the functionality to [Raixa](bit.ly/dce-raixa) instead of using RTL.

Create a test:

```ts
test(
  'description of test',
  async () => {
    ...
  },
);
```

Describe your test. Here are some examples for an email form component:

- "Updates as user types into subject field"
- "Validates recipient address properly"
- "Sends the correct request to the server when user clicks 'send'"

Inside the test, render the component of interest, including appropriate props (note this is rendered to a hidden headless browser, there is no way to see this):

```ts
Raixa.render(
  <MyComponent
    prop1={value}
    prop2="value"
  />
);
```

Once you've rendered your component, use [Raixa functions](bit.ly/dce-raixa) to test the component.

```ts
// Click the "start email button"
Raixa.click('.MyComponent-start-email-button');

// Type into the subject field
Raixa.typeInto('#MyComponent-email-subject-field', 'Test Email Subject');

// Test to make sure that the submit button is available
Raixa.assertExists('.MyComponent-submit-button');
```

If your interactable elements do not have classNames or ids, add them! Remember that if your component will ever be used in more than one place at once, use classNames. Otherwise, ids are fine.

If a test will take longer to execute, extend its timeout with a third argument:

```ts
test(
  'description of test',
  async () => {
    ...
  },
  10000, // Timeout in ms
});
```

If your component sends requests to the server, then you'll need to first stub requests (do this before `Raixa.render`). For each request that your component will send, stub that request with `stubServerRequest` from `dce-reactkit`:

```ts
import { stubServerRequest } from 'dce-reactkit';

...

test(
  'description of test',
  async () => {
    // Stub email form submission endpoint
    stubServerRequest({
      method: 'POST',
      path: '/api/ttm/threads/102398/emails',
      body: true,
    });

    // Render email form
    Raixa.render(...
  },
);
```

To stub a successful response from the server, use:

```ts
stubServerRequest({
  method: <http method that the component will use>,
  path: <path of the endpoint the component will send to>,
  body: <fake response to simulate coming back from the server>,
});
```

To stub a failed response from the server, use:

```ts
stubServerRequest({
  method: <http method that the component will use>,
  path: <path of the endpoint the component will send to>,
  errorMessage: <string error message that would come from the server>,
  errorCode: <string error code that would come from the server>,
});
```

Example of a full test:

```tsx
// Import testing lib
import Raixa from 'raixa';

// Import component to test
import EmailForm from './EmailForm';

test(
  'Shows notice when recipient email is invalid',
  async () => {
    // Render the component
    Raixa.render(
      <EmailForm
        sender="test@harvard.edu"
        onSent={() => {}}
      />
    );

    // Type an invalid recipient
    Raixa.typeInfo('.EmailForm-recipient-email-input-field', 'invalid.email@@.com');

    // Make sure validation text shows up
    Raixa.assertExists('.EmailForm-recipient-email-invalid-notice');
  },
);

test(
  'Allows email send when recipient email is valid',
  async () => {
    // Stub email form submission endpoint with a successful response
    stubServerRequest({
      method: 'POST',
      path: '/api/ttm/threads/102398/emails',
      body: true,
    });

    // Render the component
    Raixa.render(
      <EmailForm
        sender="test@harvard.edu"
        onSent={() => {}}
      />
    );

    // Type a valid recipient
    Raixa.typeInfo('.EmailForm-recipient-email-input-field', 'valid.email@gmail.com');

    // Make sure validation text is not visible
    Raixa.assertAbsent('.EmailForm-recipient-email-invalid-notice');

    // Click the "send" button
    Raixa.click('.EmailForm-send-button');

    // Make sure a success message shows up after some time
    Raixa.waitForElementPresent('.EmailForm-send-successful-message');
  },
);

test(
  'Shows an error message when the server fails',
  async () => {
    // Stub email form submission endpoint with a successful response
    stubServerRequest({
      method: 'POST',
      path: '/api/ttm/threads/102398/emails',
      errorMessage: 'The message could not be sent',
      errorCode: 'EM29',
    });

    // Render the component
    Raixa.render(
      <EmailForm
        sender="test@harvard.edu"
        onSent={() => {}}
      />
    );

    // Type a valid recipient
    Raixa.typeInfo('.EmailForm-recipient-email-input-field', 'valid.email@gmail.com');

    // Make sure validation text is not visible
    Raixa.assertAbsent('.EmailForm-recipient-email-invalid-notice');

    // Click the "send" button
    Raixa.click('.EmailForm-send-button');

    // Make sure the server's error is visible
    Raixa.assertExists('.EmailForm-error-occurred');
  },
);
```

You can stub multiple requests and Raixa will automatically know which to stub based on the method and path. If your component sends multiple requests to the _same_ method and path combo, then intersperse `stubServerRequest` throughout your test code, only stubbing right before your component sends the request.

## Running Tests

Use `npm run test-client` to start the jest test runner.

# Automated UI Testing

We use Katalon for all our end-to-end automated cross browser testing.

## Set Up Katalon

### 1. Install Katalon:

Visit [Katalon.com](https://www.katalon.com/katalon-studio/), create an account, and then install the free version of the tool.

### 2. Modify Katalon Preferences:

In Katalon's preferences panel, make the following changes:

`Katalon > Git > Enable Git Integration` â€“ Turn this off (uncheck the box)

`Katalon > Test Case > Default Open View` â€“ Set to "Script View"

`General > Editors > Text Editors > Displayed Tab Width` â€“ Set this to "2"

`General > Editors > Text Editors > Insert Spaces for Tabs` â€“ Turn this on (check the box)

## Keep Katalon Up-to-date

Regularly update your web drivers:

1. Launch Katalon
1. Under `Tools > Update WebDrivers`, one by one, click each browser and update it

## Project and File Management

All of our tests will be organized in a GitHub repo that's separate from the code. Ask your project manager about cloning that repo.

Our test case files follow a strict folder structure: there should only be one top-level folder called "All Tests" inside of the "Test Cases" folder. Then, inside "All Tests", we create one folder for each feature of the project. Name your test cases in a descriptive manner. Example: "User can log in after password is reset"

## Write a Test

Our tests are written in the `Groovy` language, which looks like `Java`.

Check out the [Kaixa Docs](https://harvard-edtech.github.io/create-kaixa/) for guides on how to write end-to-end tests, but it should feel just like writing tests with [Raixa](bit.ly/dce-raixa).

## Running a Test

1. Start a development copy of the app (server and/or client)
1. Open the test case
1. Next to the play button, click the dropdown and choose a browser

# Commonly Used Dependencies

If you're looking for a module that does one of the operations below, use these libs. Thus, when bundling, we can save space by using common libs.

`fast-clone` â€“ for fast deep clones

`papaparse` â€“ for CSV parsing and generation

`object-hash` â€“ for hashing objects

<Rule tall>
  Use dependencies listed above instead of seeking out alternatives
</Rule>

# Creating React Projects

In almost every case, let Gabe create React projects. That said, it's good to know the process:

## Create a new npm project:

1. Create a git repo and clone it
1. Initialize the project: `npm init`
1. Add a `.gitignore`
1. Initialize caccl app using `npm init caccl@latest`
1. Add eslint rules in each sub-project separately (client and server, for example): `npm init dce-eslint@latest`, remove react lines in `/server/.eslintrc.js`
1. Add `private: true` flag in `package.json`

## Set up the server:

1. Create a `server/` folder
1. Inside the `server/` folder, initialize the project: `npm init`
1. Add a `.gitignore`
1. Add `private: true` flag in `package.json`
1. If you have custom server env vars, add `**/.env` to your gitignore, install `dotenv` on the server as a dev dependency, add `import 'dotenv/config';` to the top of your server index, and add a `/server/.env` file where environment variables are listed one per line: `NAME=value`

## Set up the client

1. From the top-level directory, initialize react: `npx create-react-app --template typescript client`
1. Install bootstrap: `npm i --save bootstrap`
1. Import bootstrap in `index.tsx`:
    ```ts
    // Import bootstrap stylesheet
    import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
    import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min';
    ```
1. Install FontAwesome libs: `npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome`
1. Install SCSS with `npm i --save-dev sass`
1. Remove eslint rules from `package.json` (they're included via `dce-eslint`)

Add a script for copying types from the server to the client:

This script copies types from the server (`/server/src/shared/types`) and puts them on the client (`/client/src/shared/types`). This is extremely useful if types are shared between the server and the client, or if a database is used.

```json
  "scripts": {
		"copy-server-types": "rm -rf ./client/src/shared/types/from-server; cp -r ./server/src/shared/types ./client/src/shared/types/from-server"
	},
```

## Set up the project for deployment:

Install `dce-dev-wizard` into the project: `npm i --save-dev dce-dev-wizard`.

Add a `dceConfig.json` file with deployment information. The `name` is a human-readable deployment name, `app` is the aws name of the deployment, and `profile` is the aws profile. Example:

```json
{
  "deployments": [
    {
      "name": "Stage",
      "app": "my-app-stage",
      "profile": "stage"
    },
    {
      "name": "Prod",
      "app": "my-app-prod",
      "profile": "prod"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Add a `dev-wizard` script that is used for managing and performing deployment:

```json
  "scripts": {
		"dev-wizard": "./node_modules/.bin/dce-dev-wizard"
  }
```

## Adding Typescript Support to a Project

Once you've created the project, you need to separately add typescript support.

First, move all code into a `src/` folder and make sure your project has no top-level `lib/` folder.

Add typescript to the project:

1. Install typescript with `npm i --save-dev typescript`
1. In `package.json`, update `main` to `./lib/index.js`
1. In `package.json`, update `types` to `./lib/index.d.ts`
1. Add a build script: `tsc --project ./tsconfig.json`

Add a `tsconfig.json` file to the top-level directory of the project:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "declaration": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["DOM", "ES2015"],
    "outDir": "./lib"
  },
  "include": [
    "./src"
  ],
  "ts-node": {
    "files": true
  }
}
```

You can customize the `tsconfig.json`. This config is designed to target es5 while supporting modern standards.

If your project has non-typescript files that are required in the project, update your build script:

1. Install new dependencies `npm i --save-dev rimraf copyfiles`
1. Update your build script: `rimraf lib/ && tsc --project ./tsconfig.json && copyfiles -u 1 src/**/*.ejs src/**/*.jpg lib/`

# Creating Component Libraries

Component libraries are npm modules that contain React components that are intended for reuse. If you find yourself reusing a component across multiple projects, you might want to consider putting that component into a shared component library.

Creating a component library can be really complex and finnicky, so we've simplified our process and made some compromises. Please follow this guide, including all simplifications and compromises.

When naming your component library, include `dce` or `harvard` in the project name _unless_ it is a project that will be used across multiple universities. We don't want to be part of the npm clutter problem, so don't reserve generic names for our internal libs if you don't need to. For example, if we're creating a support library that is used for managing dates and times with respect to Cambridge, MA, don't snag the `date-manager` project name. Instead, call your library `dce-date-manager` or something.

## 1. Prepare Your Components

Before components can be added to a component library, we require that style be translated into vanilla css (not scss) and copied inline into a new section at the top of the component `.tsx` file:

```tsx
/*----------------------------------------*/
/* ---------------- Style --------------- */
/*----------------------------------------*/

const style = `
  .MyComponent-container {
    ...
  }
`;
```

Then, in the final `return` in the render function, add the style inline:

```tsx
  return (
    <div className="MyComponent-container">
      {/* Inline Style */}
      <style>
        {style}
      </style>

      ...
    </div>
  );
```

## 2. Create a Component Package

Now, we'll create an npm package that we will be publishing as open source to npm. For consistency and maintenance, Gabe will be the one who publishes and maintains these packages on npm.

First, create a new repo on GitHub, set it up using the `Node` gitignore template, write a short description of the project (and copy that description to the clipboard), and add the `MIT` license. Then, clone that repo to your computer.

Next, initialize the npm project using `npm init`. When prompted for a description, paste the description from your clipboard. When prompted for an author, use `Gabe Abrams <gabeabrams@gmail.com>`, and when prompted for a license, use "MIT".

Also, add eslint rules to the project:

```bash
npm init dce-eslint@latest
```

## 3. Set Up Build Process

Install dev dependencies:

`npm i --save-dev rollup rollup-plugin-dts rollup-plugin-sourcemaps typescript @rollup/plugin-commonjs @rollup/plugin-json @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-typescript @types/react`

Install peer dependencies, modifying for the proper versions:

```json
  // Add to package.json:
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons": "^6.x.x",
    "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons": "^6.x.x",
    "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome": "^0.x.x",
    "bootstrap": "^5.x.x",
    "react": "^x.x.x"
  },
```

Then run `npm i` to install the appropriate dependencies.

Add a build script to your `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build": "rm -rf dist && rollup -c"
  },
```

Modify/add the following lines to your `package.json`:

```json
  "main": "dist/cjs/index.js",
  "module": "dist/esm/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
```

Add a `rollup.config.js` file to the root project directory:

```js
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';
import typescript from '@rollup/plugin-typescript';
import dts from 'rollup-plugin-dts';
import sourcemaps from 'rollup-plugin-sourcemaps';

const packageJson = require('./package.json');

export default [
  {
    input: 'src/index.ts',
    output: [
      {
        file: packageJson.main,
        format: 'cjs',
        sourcemap: true,
      },
      {
        file: packageJson.module,
        format: 'esm',
        sourcemap: true,
      },
    ],
    plugins: [
      resolve(),
      commonjs(),
      typescript({ tsconfig: './tsconfig.json' }),
      sourcemaps(),
    ],
    external: [
      ...Object.keys(packageJson.dependencies || {}),
      ...Object.keys(packageJson.peerDependencies || {}),
    ],
  },
  {
    input: 'dist/esm/index.d.ts',
    output: [{ file: 'dist/index.d.ts', format: 'esm' }],
    plugins: [dts()],
    external: [
      ...Object.keys(packageJson.dependencies || {}),
      ...Object.keys(packageJson.peerDependencies || {}),
    ],
  },
];
```

Add a `tsconfig.json` file to the root project directory:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,

    "jsx": "react",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationDir": "types",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "emitDeclarationOnly": true,
    "rootDir": "src"
  },

  "include": [
    "./src/**/*"
  ]
}
```

## 4. Add Components

Create a `/src` folder and a `/src/index.ts` file that will serve as the entrypoint.

Add all components to a `/src/components` folder and follow all other normal rules for file and folder structure (naming conventions, shared folders, etc.).

In the `/src/index.ts` file, import all components, helpers, types, etc. that you want to be available to users of your package and then export them in one object:

```ts
// Components
import MyFirstComponent from './components/MyFirstComponent';
import MySecondComponent from './components/MyFirstComponent';

// Helpers
import myHelperFunction from './helpers/myHelperFunction';

// Types
import MyFirstType from './shared/types/MyFirstType';
import MySecondType from './shared/types/MySecondType';

// Export
export {
  // Components
  MyFirstComponent,
  MySecondComponent
  // Helpers
  myHelperFunction,
  // Types
  MyFirstType,
  MySecondType,
};
```

## 5. Test

One of the easiest ways to test is to create a test React app, copy your components into the app and try to use them. This is a good place to start, but won't get you all the way there, so check out `npm link` functionality and ask Gabe for specific testing strategies that will work for you.

## 6. Build and Publish

Build your component lib by running `npm run build`. If no errors occur, check the `/dist` folder for built contents.

Commit and push your code and ask Gabe to publish the library.

# Creating Support Libraries

Support libraries contain helpful, reusable code that is used across multiple projects. These support libraries cannot contain React code. If they do, consider a Component Library (see the previous section).

Creating a support library is extremely complicated and complex, so we've created this guide and need you to stick to it. What might seem to be compromises are probably careful decisions that were made to improve the build process or robustness of the library in other ways.

When naming your support library, include `dce` or `harvard` in the project name _unless_ it is a project that will be used across multiple universities. We don't want to be part of the npm clutter problem, so don't reserve generic names for our internal libs if you don't need to. For example, if we're creating a support library that is used for managing dates and times with respect to Cambridge, MA, don't snag the `date-manager` project name. Instead, call your library `dce-date-manager` or something.

## 1. Prepare Your Code

Any code that you want to place into a shared library must be 100% typescript files (`.ts`). We do not currently support assets or other types of files.

## 2. Create a Support Package

Now, we'll create an npm package that we will be publishing as open source to npm. For consistency and maintenance, Gabe will be the one who publishes and maintains these packages on npm.

First, create a new repo on GitHub, set it up using the `Node` gitignore template, write a short description of the project (and copy that description to the clipboard), and add the `MIT` license. Then, clone that repo to your computer.

Next, initialize the npm project using `npm init`. When prompted for a description, paste the description from your clipboard. When prompted for an author, use `Gabe Abrams <gabeabrams@gmail.com>`, and when prompted for a license, use "MIT".

Also, add eslint rules to the project:

```bash
npm init dce-eslint@latest
```

## 3. Set Up Build Process

Install dev dependencies:

`npm i --save-dev @types/node typescript`

Add a build script to your `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build": "tsc --project ./tsconfig.json"
  },
```

Add/modify the following `package.json` lines:

```json
  "main": "./lib/index.js",
  "types": "./lib/index.d.ts",
```

Add the following `tsconfig.json` file to the top-level of your project:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noEmitOnError": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "declaration": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "es5",
    "outDir": "./lib"
  },
  "include": [
    "./src"
  ],
  "ts-node": {
    "files": true
  }
}
```

## 4. Add Code

Add all code to a `/src` folder and follow all other normal rules for file and folder structure (naming conventions, shared folders, etc.).

In the `/src/index.ts` file, import all functions, types, etc. that you want to be available to users of your package and then export them in one object:

```ts
// Functions
import myFirstFunction from './helpers/myFirstFunction';
import mySecondFunction from './helpers/mySecondFunction';

// Types
import MyFirstType from './shared/types/MyFirstType';
import MySecondType from './shared/types/MySecondType';

// Export
export {
  // Functions
  myFirstFunction,
  mySecondFunction,
  // Types
  MyFirstType,
  MySecondType,
};
```

## 5. Test

To test your project, create a test npm project somewhere else on your machine, then follow these instructions for testing via `npm link`:

First, build your support library using `npm run build`.

Then, link your support library using `npm link`.

Finally, in your test project, run `npm link <package-name>` where `<package-name>` is the name of your support library.

Repeat these steps as necessary.

## 6. Build and Publish

Build your component lib by running `npm run build`. If no errors occur, check the `/dist` folder for built contents.

Commit and push your code and ask Gabe to publish the library.
